// The dense llama-family architectures added as one group. Their codes are
// taken from the top of the 6-bit range down, so a concurrent addition counting
// up from ArchDBRX does not collide with them; Arch.Valid asks the name tables
// rather than a maximum, so the gap between the two ends is not a code.
//
// Each is a code of its own so a reader that predates it refuses the container
// rather than running it as llama's block with a feature missing -- every one
// of those omissions is fluent.
