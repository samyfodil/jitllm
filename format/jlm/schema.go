// This file is the container's own vocabulary: the codes that appear in a .jlm
// file and what they mean, which is the whole of what a .jlm parser has to
// read. A container that stored another format's type numbers, tensor names
// and key-value metadata would be renamed, not decoupled; a converter
// translates into these codes, and nothing on the reading side asks what a
// source format called anything.

// Type is how a weight is stored in a container. The codes are this format's
// and the layouts are described here in full, because a reader must not need a
// second document.
//
// Every quantised type is stored transposed and in planes. A tensor of
// nrows x k is written as nsub = k/Sub sub-blocks; within a sub-block the
// payload is Planes[0] bits per weight followed, for the wide types, by
// Planes[1] more; and word w of sub-block s for row r is at word index
// (s*W + w)*nrows + r, W = Sub*(Planes[0]+Planes[1])/32 payload words per
// sub-block per row. Scales follow in their own arrays at the same row
// stride. See Layout for the numbers and write.go for the writer.
