// A File's weight memory -- its page frames and its dense region -- lives off
// the Go heap: anonymous mappings (kernels.MapOffHeap, the allocator the
// device arena uses) the runtime does not know exist. They are not in the
// collector's heap goal, not in its memory-limit arithmetic and not marked,
// and the File unmaps them at Close. On the heap, a frame holds no pointers and
// is never scanned, but it is permanently live heap: frames set the
// collector's goal, and a weight budget near a memory limit left the collector
// running back to back (AGENTS.md RULE 2f). Off the heap the same budget runs
// with a handful of cycles. This is anonymous memory the File owns and frees;
// the model FILE is still read, never mapped.
//
// The cost is the collector's safety net: a span into a frame that outlives
// its File's Close faults instead of keeping the frame alive. Where the
// platform has no anonymous mmap, buf falls back to the heap.
