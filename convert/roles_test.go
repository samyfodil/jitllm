// It is the writing-side gate on "a container needs no knowledge of the
// source format": a name the converter cannot place would otherwise be
// dropped, and a dropped tensor is a model that loads and is wrong. So
// identify() refuses, and this says which names would make it refuse.
//
// A model whose architecture is unsupported is expected to have tensors with no
// role (state-space blocks, for instance): those are reported, not failed,
// because the converter refuses them earlier and for a better reason.
