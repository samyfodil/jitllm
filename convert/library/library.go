// Package library is the list of models jitllm can fetch by name: for each, a
// Hugging Face repository, the file in it, and the vision tower beside it when
// there is one.
//
// An entry is a claim that the file converts and runs: it gets in by being
// downloaded, converted and made to generate on this engine
// (scripts/library-gate.sh records it in Verified), and it is pinned to the
// repository commit that was checked.
//
// It is a Go slice, not a data file: the CLI and the desktop app both import
// it and a change to it is a reviewed change to code. Sizes are what the Hub
// reports, so a disk check and a will-it-fit estimate need no request.
