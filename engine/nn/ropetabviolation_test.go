// they reach every tier: three of the kernel's four structural steps read a
// word of Scr that only that step reads (the mod-4 magic, the integer that
// turns n into n+1 for cosine's quadrant, and the negation words). Every tier
// must read these from the block rather than from immediates, or its
// violations read green while doing nothing. The sign step has two words
// because amd64 XORs a sign mask where NEON selects against an FNEG
// (ropetab_const.go).
