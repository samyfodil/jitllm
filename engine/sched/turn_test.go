// TestTurnGrantsEveryWaiter is the turn's liveness and bound gate: views of
// one crew run regions of random lengths back to back on GOMAXPROCS 1 to 4,
// with and without more busy goroutines than there are Ps, and every view
// must finish -- a lost wake-up leaves a waiter queued forever and the test
// hangs until go test's own deadline names the goroutine. The lock reports
// each queue and each handoff (onTurnQueue, onTurnGrant), and a queued view
// must be granted after at most one grant per view queued ahead of it. A
// count, not a clock. Every region must also cover its range exactly once.
//
// VIOLATION SIGNATURE. With Unlock handing the turn to the newest waiter
// instead of the oldest, a view that queues first is passed by every one that
// queues after it, and this fails with "a queued view waited N grants to
// others, bound 4".
