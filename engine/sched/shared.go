// its own pool, and two pools on the same cores are two sets of spinning
// workers behind two barriers -- the slowest worker of either is both regions'
// end. Views take turns a region at a time instead, in arrival order (turn),
// so several sessions run on the cores without a lock held across a whole
// generate and without one session's regions starving another's.
//
// A view has its own participant count (SetParticipants) and region counters;
// SetSpinning is the crew's, so the last caller's choice holds for every view.
// The crew stops when its last view is closed.
