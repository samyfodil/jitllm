// A sync.Mutex is not that: its holder relocks before a woken waiter is
// scheduled, and a waiter only forces a handoff after a millisecond of
// failing. A session whose region loop relocks at once keeps the cores for as
// long as the other's goroutine stays unscheduled -- on a host with fewer
// threads than the crew has spinning workers that was a whole short reply
// while the other session produced no token.
//
// The uncontended path is one CAS to take and one to give, as a mutex's is.
// Once a waiter is queued the state stays contended and no newcomer can take
// the turn ahead of it: Unlock hands the turn to the queue's head, so a view
// waiting runs after at most the region in flight.
