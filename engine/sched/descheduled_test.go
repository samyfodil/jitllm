// TestARegionDoesNotWaitForADescheduledWorker: a worker that has seen a
// region but is kept off a CPU -- here held at onWorkerWake, as an
// oversubscribed host holds it for a scheduling slice or many -- must not
// hold the region up: the caller drains the chunks, closes the gate and
// returns, and the held worker, once let go, finds the gate closed and
// touches nothing. On a laptop at load average 31 a pool that waited for
// every worker to acknowledge every region ran each region at the slowest
// worker's scheduling latency, and a host-only server produced no token for
// minutes.
//
// VIOLATION SIGNATURE. A publish that waits for every worker (the old
// acknowledgement count) never returns while the worker is held: the test
// hangs and go test's deadline names publish's wait.
