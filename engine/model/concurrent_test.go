// TestConcurrentMultiDeviceDoesNotLeak runs several States at once, with the
// blocks spread over every device the host has, and requires the process to
// come back after each cycle: several States sharing a tier, devices sharing a
// host budget, pools sharing cores. Concurrency is the point: sched.Pool.Do is
// single-caller, which is safe only because each State builds its own JIT, and
// a shared tier.GPU tests devTier's locking.
//
// It checks the live heap, the device byte ledger, the driver objects the
// engine owns, file descriptors, threads and goroutines, because they fail
// independently.
