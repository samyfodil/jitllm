// TestRecurrentPoolKeepsASessionAcrossOthers: a hybrid device keeps every
// session's recurrent state for a block in one pool (tier/recpool.go), so a
// session arriving grows every pool, and the last-seated one leaving shrinks
// them -- each a new pair of buffers, with every other session's state carried
// across. A session that decodes through both must read exactly what it would
// alone: same tier, same blocks, same arithmetic, so the bar is bit equality.
//
// The session under test does not sit at slot 0: one seated ahead of it
// leaves before the last shrink, so that shrink carries a run of seats that
// starts above the pool's first slot, and a carry that lands at the wrong
// offset is a wrong state rather than an accident of addressing from zero.
// Stats.RecBytes is the check that the pools did move: grown by the arrivals,
// back to two slots when they have gone. Stats.RecCarryBytes is the check that
// the states crossed, and backend.HostReads that they crossed on the device:
// every arrival (SetDevice) and departure (Close) reads nothing to the host.
