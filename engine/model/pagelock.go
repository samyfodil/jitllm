package model

// enterPager serialises decode on a container whose budget is smaller than its
// pages, and does nothing at all on one that fits. It returns the release, so
// every caller is one deferred line.
//
// Every span a container hands out is a slice of a reused frame, so a second
// session's page-in can take memory the first is still reading; jlm's own lock
// makes that memory-safe but not correct, since model.layer holds spans for a
// whole block's compute. One coarse lock covers every such window (host loop,
// device upload, streamed expert fill, tower) at once, at the cost of
// cross-session parallelism on a paging model.
//
// It is conditional: a model that fits never evicts, so sessions may read spans
// concurrently (TestConcurrentMultiDeviceDoesNotLeak), and the check is one
// atomic load via jlm.CanEvict.
//
// It goes on the public boundary only, because the inner paths nest and
// sync.Mutex is not reentrant: the gated set is exactly Forward, Prefill,
// PrefillSeq, PrefillCached and ForwardBatch, none of which calls another.
