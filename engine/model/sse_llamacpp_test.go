// with the SSE tier forced -- the same gate, the same tie rule (a divergence
// on a knife-edge margin is reduction order, not a bug), and no AVX2 kernel
// mapped while it runs. It is the external-package twin of TestSSEModelGates,
// which cannot call this package's TestGreedyMatchesLlamaCpp.
//
// Like the other model-level SSE gates it needs every SSE family, and until
// then it fails naming the ops still pending rather than skip.
