// TestConcurrentPlacementGivesEachStateItsOwnHistory: States attaching to one
// tier at once must each come away with their own history on every block they
// placed, so each one's first prompt runs where it was placed.
//
// A block takes a session's history when it is offered -- a linear block's
// recurrent state, an attention block's KV -- and the device files it under
// whichever session is current. The offers went through the shared tier
// (State.ldCand) rather than the State's own view, so the current session was
// whichever had made the last call: with two States placing at once, a block
// found the OTHER State's history already there and gave this one none. The
// placement still counted every block, and the State's first prompt then
// failed on the device ("block 0 has no recurrent state for session N") and
// demoted every block to the host -- correct tokens, from the host, which is
// how a server creating sessions per request ran most of them there.
//
// The assertion is per State after its first prompt: every block still on the
// device and no demotion. Against offers made through the shared tier, one of
// each pair of States demotes in nearly every round.
