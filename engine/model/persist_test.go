package model

// carried says whether the positions in over (ascending, each past a gate's
// bound) are damage that persists, out of n compared in order: more than a
// quarter of them, three in a row, or the last one, which has nothing after it
// to show whether it carried.
//
// A defect in a stored row or a kernel reaches every position after the one it
// hits, since every later position reads that row. A model can also amplify a
// rounding at a few positions and pass it no further: a router that takes one
// decision the other way, or a neuron that moves 25% for a 4% input change.
// A windowed or chunked layer lets a corrupted row fall out of reach, so the
// damage can stop carrying after a few positions, which is why three in a row
// is enough.
