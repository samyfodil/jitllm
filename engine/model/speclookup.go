// Prompt lookup: speculation with no prediction block. A round drafts the
// tokens that followed the latest earlier occurrence of the sequence's last
// n-gram (the longest n in [ngMin, ngMax] that occurs), and the trunk
// verifies them exactly as it verifies the prediction block's drafts, with
// the same rollback of attention by position and of a recurrence by
// SpecRollback. Nothing runs to draft, so a round that finds no match is a
// decode step: one row, no wasted verification. This is llama.cpp's
// prompt lookup and vLLM's ngram proposer; the choice of n and of the latest
// occurrence is in docs/engineering-history/model-correctness.md,
// "engine/model/speclookup.go".
//
// RULE 8: the search compares token ids, integers the sampler has already
// decided, and decides only which rows the next verification carries. No
// value of any row's arithmetic depends on it -- a wrong proposal changes how
// many tokens a pass yields, never which -- so it is control, like the
// acceptance comparison beside it, and stays Go.

// one token matches too often to be worth a verification row, and four is
// already rare outside a verbatim copy.
