// The KV cache is paged, and its pages are its own.
//
// It is not the weight pager: a weight page is fixed at conversion, never
// changes and always has a copy on disk, while KV pages grow one position per
// token per layer, the tail page is written every token, and until something
// stores a page there is no other copy. Consequences:
//
//   - Pages behind the tail are immutable, so they are safe to store, share or
//     drop.
//   - There is no fault on the write path: a new page is needed exactly when
//     pos%P == 0, so the write path allocates.
//   - Reads span every page: attention at position n reads 0..n (see kvSpan).
//
// The page size is per layer: a linear-attention layer gets no pages, a
// sliding-window layer one page of its window, and an ordinary attention
// layer a run of positions aligned to the score kernel's tile.

// ErrNoPage is what a store returns when it simply does not hold the page.
//
// A miss means "compute it"; any other error means the store is broken, and
// treating the two alike would silently drop a sequence's history.

// destination that can alias memory skip the copy.
//
// cacheId is opaque to the engine and identifies one history. The caller can
// make it content-addressed ("<model>/<sha256 of the prompt prefix>"), which
// is how a later process finds an earlier one's pages; a counter or a
// Scheduler row would address another prompt's pages. Two sessions sharing a
