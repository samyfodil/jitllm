//
// A block that does not fit on the card runs on the host, and for decode that
// is the right place: a token is bandwidth-bound, and the host reads the
// block's bytes from its own memory where streaming it would read them and then
// cross the link. A prompt is compute-bound, and one upload serves a whole chunk
// of rows, so the same block may be faster streamed for the prompt. Whether it is
// depends on the link, the card and the host in front of it, so it is measured:
// the first chunk runs as placed, the second with the host blocks streamed (their
// history moved up, outside the timed window), and the faster rate per token
// keeps the rest of the prompt. After the prompt the streamed blocks go home,
// history and all, once, and decode runs as placed.
//
// It is a placement like any other, so the caller forces it either way
// (WithPrefillStream).
