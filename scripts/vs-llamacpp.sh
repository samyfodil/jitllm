# ★ WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A COMMAND LINE. Every previous version of this
# comparison was typed by hand, and three separate things went wrong that way:
# a baseline was quoted from a llama.cpp version measured weeks earlier (RULE
# 1a), a jitllm-on-CUDA number was compared against llama.cpp-on-VULKAN (RULE 1d),
# and the two engines were run A-then-B while the box drifted (RULE 2). All
# three are decisions about HOW to invoke, so they belong next to the invocation.
#
# ★ IT IS THE ONE MEASUREMENT jitllm CANNOT DO IN ONE PROCESS. RULE 6 records that
# a cross-process A/B came back at IQR/median 0.123 and was rejected -- but the
# other engine is another program, so there is no in-process option here and the
# answer is to interleave hard and report the dispersion honestly rather than to
# pretend. ABBA rather than ABAB for the same reason the tuner uses it (RULE 5e):
# a fixed order lets any drift accumulate on one side.
set -euo pipefail

# ★ THE WHOLE COMPARISON HOLDS THE MEASUREMENT LOCK, AND RUNS UNDER NO MEMORY CGROUP.
#
# A comparison is ATOMIC: locking each sample separately would let an
# interloper take the lock between two samples of the same ABBA round. So the
# script takes scripts/cap's lock file EXCLUSIVE once and holds it to the end;
# builds still take it shared through scripts/cap and wait.
#
# It used to get that lock by re-execing itself under scripts/cap, which also
# put both engines inside an 8G memory cgroup on every host. That cgroup charges
# llama.cpp's mmap page cache and throttles it at MemoryHigh, while jitllm reads
# with O_DIRECT, so a large model's row measured the cap as well as the engines.
# scripts/cap protects the developer's own machine (AGENTS.md RULE 3); a bench
# host runs both engines bare. On the laptop the hook still wants the outer
# command wrapped in scripts/cap, which classifies this script as a measurement
# and already holds the lock EXCLUSIVE on fd 9 when it starts. A second open of
# the file would be a second lock and wait on its own parent forever, so when
# fd 9 is that file the script re-takes the lock on the SAME descriptor, which
# is immediate. JITLLM_NO_LOCK=1 opts out, as it does in scripts/cap.

# jitllm runs the jlm container -- it reads nothing else -- and llama.cpp

# ★ AND IT RECONVERTS WHEN THE BINARY IS NEWER, NOT ONLY WHEN THE FILE IS

# "container is version 4 and this build reads 5".
# JITLLM_BIN is what the measurement below runs (see the JITLLM= line further

# THE COHERENCE GATE. Averaging /proc/cpuinfo over ALL cpus mixes the measured
# cores with idle ones, and the two engines do not leave the same cores idle:
# jitllm's pool SPINS for 250 us (this file records 60e9 instructions of workers
# WAITING) which holds its cores' clocks up, where llama.cpp's threads park. The
# result was a SYSTEMATIC separation -- jitllm's sampled MHz exceeded
# llama.cpp's in 27 of 32 pairs, median ratio 1.080 -- against a coherence
# threshold of 1.05. A threshold under the systematic separation does not remove
# outliers; it removes the MAJORITY. It discarded 23 of 32 pairs on one pass and
# 15 of 20 on an olmoe pass, which is what rejected that row at n=5.
#
# CORES is the taskset this row pins to, so these are the only clocks the ratio
# is about. Falling back to the package average keeps darwin and any host

# This laptop saturates within seconds of six-core AVX2 and settles at 100 C with
# the clocks pinned; on the way there it passes through every frequency in
# between. Measured on tinyllama, the SAME A/B three ways:
#
#   cold start, back to back      two passes read 0.9733 and 0.8530  -- 14% apart
#   6 s cooldown between samples  IQR/median 0.154                   -- REJECTED
#   soaked first, then measured   IQR/median 0.067, reproducible     -- usable
#
# Cooling between samples is the intuitive fix and it is the wrong one: it puts
# every sample at a DIFFERENT point on the ramp. Saturating first puts them all
# at the same point, which happens to be the slowest one -- and the slowest one
# is stable, which is what a ratio needs. Absolute numbers from a soaked run are
# ~20% under this box's peak and are not comparable with a cold single run; the
# RATIO is the measurement and it is the only thing quoted.
#
# It also serves the other two warm-ups for free: jitllm's tuner converges over the
# first tokens (RULE 2a) and both engines fault in the weight file.
