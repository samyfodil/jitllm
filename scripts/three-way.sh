# Prove that ONE model runs with its blocks split across the HOST, a CUDA device
# and a SECOND PHYSICAL device reached through Vulkan -- all three carrying real
# work in a single run -- and that the tokens are the ones the host alone
# produces.
#
# ★ IT IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A TRANSCRIPT BECAUSE A TRANSCRIPT CANNOT BE RE-RUN.
# The claim it makes is the kind that rots silently: a router change that sends
# every block to the first device, a budget change that starves the second, a
# kernel that quietly computes garbage on the card nobody benchmarks -- each of
# those leaves a run that still prints a rate and still answers in English.
# Every one of them fails an assertion here.
#
# ★ WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY EACH ONE EXISTS (--violate NAME breaks exactly one
# of them on purpose; a gate that has never been seen to fail is not a gate):
#
#   ids        the three-way run's token ids equal `-devices cpu`'s, same prompt,
#              same greedy sampling. THE LOAD-BEARING ONE: a device that computes
#              garbage, or that declines every block while reporting success,
#              gives a run that looks exactly like a working one.
#              violation: --violate ids (compare against a doctored reference)
#   devices    both devices RAN blocks, not merely held them. tier.Stats.Blocks
#              counts submissions that returned and whose output was copied back,
#              per device, so "placed 6, run 0" is visible.
#              violation: --violate one-device
#   distinct   the two devices are different PHYSICAL devices. On this laptop the
#              discrete card answers to BOTH cuda:0 and vulkan:0, so a two-entry
#              spec that looks like a split can be one card twice -- the single
#              most likely way this ships broken.
#              violation: --violate same-card
#   host       the host still ran blocks. Two devices taking the whole model is a
#              different configuration wearing the same output.
#              violation: --violate host
#   repeat     the second run agrees with the first, so the placement is not an
#              ordering accident.
#   negative   with one device budgeted out, the block counts MOVE and the ids
#              STILL match. If the ids matched no matter what, nothing on the
#              devices would be reaching the tokens.
#
# ★ THE SECOND DEVICE USED TO NEED JITLLM_GPU_SOFTMAX=scalar HERE, AND THAT
# WORKAROUND IS GONE. The Iris Xe reports minSubgroupSize 8 /
# maxSubgroupSize 32 and chooses a width per shader, so a 32-lane butterfly
# reduction was undefined behaviour on it -- correct under an on-device probe,
# NaN logits inside a real submission of two or more blocks. The width is now
# PINNED at pipeline creation (VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control) on every device that
# will promise it, and the scalar twin is selected by construction on every
# device that will not, so this script sets nothing. `--violate subgroup-width`
# puts the bug back -- JITLLM_VK_SUBGROUP=force assumes the width instead of
# pinning it -- and the `ids` assertion must then fail.
#
# ★ THE MODEL HAS TO BE ONE THE DEVICE TIER ALREADY REPRODUCES, AND THAT IS NOT
# EVERY MODEL. This compares whole greedy CHAINS, so one flipped argmax anywhere
# makes every later id differ (RULE 12i) -- and a model the device gets wrong on
# ONE card is wrong on two. tinyllama q3_K_M is clean on both devices here --
# the free-running greedy chains this script compares matched `-devices cpu`
# exactly in every pass and both negative controls. Its teacher-forced diff is
# 0/12 on four runs of six and 1/12 on the other two, ALWAYS at position 4, whose
# HOST-side argmax margin is 0.000162: a coin-flip the f32 seam decides either
# way, not a device fault. The same harness on the NVIDIA card reports
# max|dlogit| 0.599-0.682 against the iGPU's 0.605-0.717, so the band is the
# seam's, not this device's. Qwen2-1.5B is NOT clean, at
# 7/12 and max|dlogit| 19 on one CUDA card with no split at all, at this commit
# and at the commit before any of this work. The script says so rather than
# blaming the router: see the single-device note it prints on a failure.

# ★ THE TUNER IS PINNED, AND NOT PINNING IT IS WHY THIS SCRIPT FAILED ~1 RUN IN

# with it, varies PER PROCESS. AGENTS.md already said so in the entry on
# CPU-vs-device equality: "Run-to-run it is the SPLIT TUNER ... JITLLM_GPU_TUNE=0
# makes three runs identical. Pin it before comparing anything." This script did
# not pin it, so it was asserting bit-stability across a knob that legitimately

#     split 32           correct
#
# and `jitllm verify` names the mechanism at the flip: "pos 5: cpu 35490
# (margin 0.00167)". A 0.0017-logit margin is inside the reduction-order band
# this file documents at 0.2-0.94, so the argmax is a coin flip and greedy
