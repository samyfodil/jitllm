# The 70B claim, made re-runnable: a 4 GiB card runs EVERY block of a 39.59 GiB
# model instead of two of them, and answers the same tokens.
#
# ★ WHY A SECOND SCRIPT AND NOT A FLAG ON scripts/paging.sh. That one proves the
# MECHANISM on a model small enough to iterate on -- it can run its seven arms in
# a minute and it is the gate to run after touching page.go. This one is the
# EVIDENCE for the configuration the mechanism was built for, and it is a
# different kind of job: one arm loads 42.5 GB through a 4 GiB card, no arm
# finishes in under a minute, and the model does not fit in host RAM either, so
# every number here is also a statement about NVMe. Folding it into paging.sh
# would make the fast gate slow and the slow evidence look like a unit test.
#
# ★ THE BEFORE IS RE-MEASURED, NOT QUOTED (RULE 1). "2/80 blocks, 1.22 GiB" is on
# record and a recorded baseline is exactly what RULE 1 refuses:
# the before arm here runs in the same pass, on the same binary, at the same
# pinned budget as the after arm, so the two numbers are comparable by
# construction. They differ from the record because the record took whatever the
# card had free that day and this pins -devices cuda:0=$BUDGET.
#
# ★ WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND THE --violate NAME THAT BREAKS EXACTLY ONE. A gate that
# has never been seen to fail is not a gate (RULE 10b).
#
#   every-block  paging ON places ALL NLayer blocks on the device where the SAME
#                budget with paging off places a handful.
#                violation: --violate no-paging
#   paged        that run's page-in counter is NON-ZERO. Without it "every block
#                placed" is also true of a tier that accepted every block and
#                quietly kept six.
#                violation: --violate no-paging (same arm, it reads 0)
#   arithmetic   the page-ins are what the slot arithmetic predicts, and the
#                arithmetic is page.go's own: slots = BUDGET / the widest block.
#                Under MRU the resident set is a pinned prefix plus the cursor,
#                so exactly NLayer-C blocks miss on EVERY pass and
#                page-ins = (NLayer-C) x passes for one C. The check is that C
#                agrees with budget/bytes-per-page-in, and that the streaming is
#                uniform, and that 1 <= C < NLayer.
#
#                ★ IT IS CHECKED AGAINST THE BUDGET AND NOT AGAINST Stats.Slots,
#                AND THAT IS A CORRECTION. Slots is the tier's own estimate,
#                computed at the end of LOAD from limit-minus-permanent, and it
#                is neither an upper nor a lower bound on what the run achieves:
#                measured here, tinyllama at 400M reported 13 and kept 16, and
#                the 70B at 2G reported 3 and kept 2.4. Gating on it made this
#                assertion a test of an estimate. The budget is the number the
#                user set and the one page.go divides, so it is the one to
#                divide here.
#
#                ★ AND THE SLACK IS 1.5 BLOCKS BECAUSE THE PERMANENT PARTS COME
#                OUT OF THE SAME BUDGET -- the KV cache, the norms, the biases,
#                the block scratch and the output projection are all charged to
#                it and none of them is counted in bytes-per-page-in. It is a
#                loose band on a 70B, where the whole budget buys three blocks;
#                what it still separates is the failure that matters, an LRU
#                policy on a cyclic scan, which keeps NOTHING and reads C ~ 0.
#                violation: --violate no-paging or --violate declines
#   executed     ★ THE ONE THE OTHER THREE CANNOT COVER. A pager that swapped
#                every block in and then DECLINED every compute places NLayer of
#                NLayer, prints every page counter, runs on the host and answers
#                in English. So this reads tier.Stats.Blocks -- incremented after
#                a submission RETURNED and its output was copied back -- and
#                requires NLayer per forward pass, not merely more than zero.
#                violation: --violate declines (shrink the budget below the slot
#                floor mid-generation: placement stays NLayer/NLayer, the ids
#                stay identical, and the executed count collapses)
#   ids          the paged run's ids equal `-devices cpu`'s. Necessary and NOT
#                sufficient, which is what `executed` is for.
#                violation: --violate ids (doctor the reference)
#   unpacked     ★ WHERE THE BITS WERE EXTRACTED, WHICH THE FOUR ABOVE CANNOT
#                SEE. Every one of them is equally true of the engine at
#                60e530b, which paged the same eighty blocks and spent 69% of
#                the token repacking them on six host cores at 0.90 GB/s.
#                Stats.Unpacks counts tensors whose RAW GGUF bytes were uploaded
#                and turned into the device layout by a kernel, so it is zero
#                there and non-zero only when a card did the extraction.
#                violation: --violate no-unpack (JITLLM_GPU_UNPACK=0, which IS
#                the 60e530b engine: same placement, same ids, same page-ins)
#   accounting   the four terms of a page-in -- host pack, upload, device
#                unpack, block compute -- fit inside the seconds that elapsed,
#                and the host pack is no longer the largest of them. Both halves
#                are SUBTRACTED from the run's own counters rather than
#                estimated: cmd/jitllm prints pack/upload/unpack in the load
#                banner and again at the end, so (end - load) is what the tokens
#                paid. The 60e530b decomposition multiplied a load-time RATE by
#                a per-token byte count, and the error in that estimate landed in
#                the unaccounted remainder where nothing could argue with it.
#                violation: --violate accounting (doctor the wall, as --violate
#                ids doctors the reference: the terms then exceed it)
#
# ★ AND `accounting` NEEDS A MODEL WHOSE PAGE-IN COSTS SECONDS, WHICH IS A
# SMALLER CLAIM THAN THE ONE THAT STOOD HERE. That text said a q3_K_M model has
# no covered tensor; it is wrong, measured -- tinyllama at 200M pages 374 Q4_K
# tensors and `unpacked` is green on it, because q3_K_M is a MIXTURE and its
# attention and gate matrices are Q4_K. What tinyllama cannot do is decide the
# decomposition: its four terms are tenths of a second over a pass and each is
# the difference of two numbers the load banner rounded to the millisecond, so a
# verdict there is arithmetic on noise. The script prints NOT DECIDED rather
# than a green line (RULE 10a), which also means --violate accounting has to run
# on the 70B. Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Q4_K_M is 84.2% Q4_K by element, its blocks
# are 0.517 GiB, and it is the model both of these are about.
#   budget       ★ THE BUDGET IS THE CONTROL, NOT THE MODEL. A second, SMALLER
#                budget must give a smaller slot count, and the run must be worse
#                in the way the arithmetic predicts -- which is one of TWO
#                outcomes and the script says which it got:
#                  above the slot floor: every block is still placed and there
#                    are strictly MORE page-ins (tinyllama, 200M -> 120M);
#                  below it: there is nowhere to swap through, so the tier
#                    declines exactly as it did before paging existed and places
#                    FEWER blocks (Llama-3.3-70B, 2G -> 1G, 80/80 -> 1/80).
#                The second is not a weaker result than the first: minSlots is 2
#                and a 4 GiB card holds three blocks of a 70B, so the floor is a
#                real edge of this card and the budget is what decides which side
#                of it the run lands on.
#                violation: --violate budget (make the second budget equal to the
#                first; the slot count does not move)
#
# ★ AND THE FITS ARM, WHICH IS RULE 6's OBLIGATION AND IS MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED.
# A model that fits must pay NOTHING for the machinery being present: zero
# page-ins, zero page-outs, and a rate indistinguishable from the same budget
# with paging off. That one is cheap enough to do properly -- ABBA interleaved,
# A/A self-control first, median of per-round ratios with its IQR -- so it is,
# on tinyllama, in --rate mode.
#
# ★ WHAT IS NOT ASSERTED: THE 70B's RATE. It is REPORTED, by --rate, and the
# report is a measurement rather than a gate because the answer is not known in
# advance and a gate on it would be a gate on the box's NVMe. See the doc.
#
# ★ RUN THE VIOLATIONS ON A SMALL MODEL WHERE THE ASSERTION ALLOWS IT, AND THE
# TWO NEW ONES DO NOT. ids, no-paging, budget and declines read counters rather
# than weights, so tinyllama proves they can fail in a minute:
#
#   scripts/paging-70b.sh -m .../tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M.gguf -b 200M -B 120M \
#                         -n 6 --violate ids
#
# ★ no-unpack AND accounting ARE PROVED ON THE 70B ITSELF, and the reason is
# worth stating because the obvious shortcut is wrong twice over. A q3_K_M model
# has no covered tensor, so `unpacked` fails there whatever the engine does --
# and a violation run that "fails" for a reason the violation did not cause
# proves nothing (RULE 10b). The Q4_K models small enough to be quick then fail
# `arithmetic` for an unrelated reason: its slack is 1.5 blocks, sized on a 70B
# whose output projection is about one block, and a 1B's head is FOUR of its
# blocks. Llama-3.2-1B at 200M keeps 3.4 blocks where the budget buys 5.1, which
# is the head, correctly, and not a pager fault.
