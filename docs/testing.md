# How tests find models

Model files (GGUFs, `.jlm` containers, HuggingFace directories) are too big to
commit, all but one: `internal/testmodels/fetch.sh` downloads the rest (see
"Getting the models" below). Every test that needs one finds it through
`internal/testmodels`, which reads one variable:

| variable | meaning | unset |
|---|---|---|
| `JITLLM_MODELS` | the model directory | `models/` at the repository root |
| `JITLLM_MODEL_FREE` | `1`: a missing model skips instead of failing (CI only, see "What CI runs") | a missing model fails |

The fallback is located by walking up from the test's working directory to the
`go.mod` that declares `github.com/jitllm/jitllm` -- so it is the same
directory from every package, including the nested `ui/` and `server/` modules.
`models/` may be a symlink to a model disk; otherwise point the variable at
the models instead of faking the link:

    JITLLM_MODELS=/mnt/models/jitllm ./scripts/cap 16G -- go test ./engine/model -run TestGreedyMatchesLlamaCpp -count=1

`JITLLM_MODELS` is the same variable `jitllm fetch` uses for where a download
lands, so one setting serves both. A test binary shipped to another host has
no `go.mod` above it, so set the variable in the remote run's environment
(the arm64 and Xeon runs were driven by local helpers, not in the repo).

## A missing model is loud

A gate whose model is absent says so and names the path it looked at:

    MODEL MISSING: /nonexistent/tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M.gguf (set JITLLM_MODELS to the model directory) -- this gate proved nothing

Some gates FAIL rather than skip on a missing model (RULE 11: a missing
artefact is a task). They say so through one function,
`testmodels.Missing`, which fails the test -- unless `JITLLM_MODEL_FREE=1`,
where it skips with the same message. Only CI's model-free run
(`.github/scripts/test-model-free.sh`) sets it; a box meant to hold the
models leaves it unset. Neither a skip nor a model-free run is a pass; read
the skip lines of a run.

A new test that needs a model reports its absence through
`testmodels.Missing` (or skips, as `jlmOf` does), never a bare `t.Fatal`: a
bare failure is red in the model-free run, and CI does not keep a list of
names to excuse it.

## What CI runs

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` has four jobs, every one with `CGO_ENABLED=0` as
the release builds:

- **build** cross-compiles the five modules (root, server, common, ui, tui) for every release target from
  one Linux runner.
- **check**: gofmt, `go mod tidy`, buf lint and format, and that
  `server/gen` is what `buf generate` writes.
- **test**, on linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/arm64 and windows/amd64:
  `scripts/vet` over the engine and `server/`, then
  `.github/scripts/test-model-free.sh` (the program is `scripts/modelfree`,
  Go so that one runner serves all four hosts). On Windows it first builds
  the five modules natively, links `jitllm.exe` and `jitllmd.exe`, and runs
  `jitllm hardware`.
- **ui**, on linux/amd64, darwin/arm64 and windows/amd64: builds the `ui`
  module and the `jitllm-ui` binary, `scripts/vet ui`, and the mock-engine
  tests, `./mock ./stage ./cmd/shots` -- `stage` plays every scenario of
  package `mock` through the mounted window and checks each frame, offscreen,
  with no display, GPU or model. On Linux it also starts `jitllm-ui -mock`
  under Xvfb with Mesa's software Vulkan (lavapipe), holds that it is still
  running after 20 seconds, and keeps a screenshot as the run's
  `jitllm-ui-mock` artifact (`.github/scripts/ui-smoke.sh`). Under Xvfb the
  window presents no frame -- the screenshot is black while vkcube on the same
  display draws -- so the picture is reported, not gated.

The model-free run is every package of the five modules but `./dev/bench`
(its perf floors want a quiet box, RULE 4), `./ui/stage` (the ui job's) and,
on macOS, `./jit/gpu/backend` (the runner's paravirtual Metal device allows
512-thread pipelines, and the backend's gates force 1024-thread splits),
`engine/model` and `common/engine` included, plus the SSE tier under
`-tags jitllmtest` on amd64, Windows included. It sets `JITLLM_MODEL_FREE=1`
and points `JITLLM_MODELS` at a fresh directory holding only the committed
`stories260K.gguf` and the container this build converts from it, so every
gate that runs on stories260K runs, on the CPU; everything else skips with its
MODEL MISSING line. No model is downloaded, and the Linux and Windows runners
have no GPU. The job summary counts each run and lists every skip with its
reason. Run it locally the same way, with the GPUs hidden:

    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= VK_DRIVER_FILES=/nonexistent.json ./scripts/cap 8G -- .github/scripts/test-model-free.sh

On Windows the x86 encoding gate needs GNU objdump, which the job puts on the
PATH from the image's MinGW or Strawberry Perl. Windows-only test code uses
build constraints or portable calls: the cross-process GPU test lock is
`internal/testlock` (flock on Unix, LockFileEx on Windows), and
`GOOS=windows ./scripts/vet` type-checks every test file for Windows from a
Linux box; `scripts/vet` allows three more `unsafe.Pointer` findings there,
the OS addresses of VirtualAlloc and MapViewOfFile (the script argues them).

## Getting the models

`internal/testmodels/fetch.sh` downloads every model file a test reads into
the model directory (`$JITLLM_MODELS`, or `models/`). Its table -- name, repo,
file, bytes -- is the one record of where each test model comes from, and
every entry was checked byte for byte against the copy the goldens were taken
on:

    internal/testmodels/fetch.sh --list          # the table, sizes, what is here
    internal/testmodels/fetch.sh                 # the default set, ~40 GB
    internal/testmodels/fetch.sh llama gemma     # only names containing a word
    internal/testmodels/fetch.sh --large scout   # an opt-in large model

A file already present at the table's size is skipped, and a partial download
resumes. The default set is what a normal `go test ./...` reads: GGUFs and
their vision projectors, the embedding models under `embed/`, and the
HuggingFace directories the safetensors converter is gated on
(`tiny-random-*`, `qwen3`, `SmolLM2-360M-Instruct`, ...). `--large` adds the
files over ~10 GB and the ones only an override variable reaches (the 80B,
Kimi-Linear, Moonlight, Mixtral, Llama-4-Scout, gpt-oss-20b, DeepSeek-V2-Lite,
phi-4, falcon-7b). Two gates fail rather than skip without `--large`:
`engine/model` `TestGPTOSSMatchesLlamaCppIntermediates` and
`tok` `TestDecodeChatRendersHarmonyChannels` both need gpt-oss-20b.
`HF_TOKEN` is sent to huggingface.co when set; no entry needs it.

Committed rather than fetched: `testdata/models/stories260K.gguf` (1.1 MB), so
`go test ./convert/gguf` runs on a fresh checkout with no network. The script
copies it into the model directory, where other tests look for it.

The script fetches no `.jlm`. A test that names a container reads the one
converted from the GGUF of the same stem: the `engine/model` gates write it
beside the GGUF on first use, or convert it yourself with
`go run ./cmd/jitllm convert <dir>/<name>.gguf`.

Made rather than fetched -- the script's header has the commands:

- the `synth-*` fixtures: `scripts/hfgold.py`, `scripts/c6gold.py`,
  `scripts/llama4gold.py` and `scripts/gptossgold.py` build them with the
  reference's own classes, in the CPU torch/transformers venv each script's
  header describes (`hfgold.py` starts several from the downloaded tiny-random
  directories);
- `tiny-qwen3moe-f32.gguf`: `scripts/tiny-moe-gguf.py`, from `tiny-qwen3moe-hf/`;
- `split-test/`: `convert.TestSplitGGUFConvertsLikeTheWholeFile` needs
  tinyllama split by llama.cpp's own tool, in the model directory:

      llama-gguf-split --split --split-max-tensors 60 tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M.gguf split-test/tl

## Choosing WHICH model

`JITLLM_MODELS` says WHERE. The variables below say WHICH, per test. A value
that is a bare file name is looked up in the model directory; a value with a
`/` in it is a path and is used as written. "Substring" variables filter a
sweep by name and are never resolved.

| variable | tests | value | unset |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JITLLM_MODEL` | `model.TestFusionCeiling` | one model file | every model |
| | `model.TestForwardEmbdMatchesForward`, `TestPrefillMixedMatchesPrefill` | one model file | every language model under 2 GiB |
| | `model.TestPrefillRegionProbe` | one model file | `tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M.gguf` |
| | `model.TestDeviceDecodeRate`, `TestSamplerPerf` | one model file (a container for the sampler) | test skips |
| `JITLLM_BENCH_MODEL` | `model` gates that call `benchModel` (e.g. `TestPrefillMatchesForward`) | one model file | the smallest quantized language model in the directory |
| | `model.TestABKQuantAccsEndToEnd` | a k-quant model file | test skips |
| | `model.BenchmarkGemmaDecode` | one model file | `gemma-2b.gguf` |
| `JITLLM_ROUTE_MODEL` | `model.TestRoutingLocality`, `TestHotnessIsAProbability` | a mixture-of-experts model file | test skips |
| `JITLLM_MLA_MODEL` | `model.TestMLAPrefillMatchesDecode`, `TestMLABatchMatchesDecode` | a real MLA model (name or path) | the synth-deepseek fixtures |
| `JITLLM_DEV_MODEL` | `jit/gpu/tier.TestContainerAgreesHostAndDevice` | one file name in the directory | first present of tinyllama, Llama-3.2-1B, Qwen3-MoE, gemma-2b, olmoe |
| `JITLLM_LABELCOST_MODEL` | `model.TestRegionLabelCost` | file name in the directory | `tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M.gguf` |
| `JITLLM_LABELRATE_MODEL` | `model.TestRegionLabelRate` | file name in the directory | `tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M.gguf` |
| `JITLLM_KVPERF_MODEL` | `model.TestPagedKVCost` | file name in the directory | `tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M.gguf` |
| `JITLLM_KVPREFIX_MODEL` | `model.TestPrefixCacheSpeedup` | file name in the directory | `tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M.gguf` |
| `JITLLM_KVPREC_MODEL` | `model.TestKVPrecisionCost` | exact base name | every model under 2 GiB |
| `JITLLM_GREEDY_MODEL` | `model.TestGreedyMatchesLlamaCpp` | substring | every model; over 2 GiB only with `JITLLM_SLOW=1` |
| `JITLLM_GREEDY_PAIR` | `model.TestGreedyMatchesLlamaCpp` | `<gguf>=<container>`, each name or path | GGUFs converted by the test |
| `JITLLM_KVSWEEP_MODEL` | `model.TestPagedKVIsTokenIdenticalOnEveryModel` | substring | every model under 2 GiB |
| `JITLLM_AUDIT_MODEL` | `model.TestEveryModelRunsGenerated` | substring, any size | every model under 2 GiB (`JITLLM_SLOW=1`: all) in the directory, one level down, and the safetensors fixtures with an `hf` golden |
| `JITLLM_TOKMODEL` | `model.TestTokenizerCost` | substring | its fixed list |
| `JITLLM_ROLE_MODEL` | `convert.TestEveryTensorHasARole` | substring | every GGUF |
| `JITLLM_ST_MODEL` | `convert.TestSafetensorsArchCoverage` | substring | every HuggingFace directory |
| `JITLLM_C6_HF` | `convert.TestDenseSafetensorsMatchesItsGGUF` | the directory `scripts/c6gold.py` writes its HuggingFace fixtures to (its `CV_HF`) | `$JITLLM_MODELS/hf` |
| `JITLLM_TPL_MODEL` | `jinja.TestGGUFChatTemplatesRender` | substring | every GGUF |
| `JITLLM_SERVER_MODEL` | `server.TestEndToEndAgainstARealContainer` | a `.jlm` container | test skips |
| `JITLLM_SERVER_BATCH_MODELS` | `server.TestBatch*` | comma-separated `.jlm` names or paths, each run beside the default | `stories15M-q8_0.jlm` only |
| `JITLLM_TOOL_MODELS` | `server.TestToolChoiceForcesACall` | comma-separated `.jlm` names, in place of the default | `Qwen3-0.6B-Q8_0.jlm` and `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.jlm`; also run with Qwen3.5-0.8B-f16, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-Q4_K_M and gpt-oss-20b-Q4_K_M |
| `JITLLM_STEP_MIXTURE` | `model.TestStepAcrossSessionsMixture*` | comma-separated names or paths | Qwen3-MoE-4x0.6B and olmoe; a card that cannot place every block skips |
| `JITLLM_ALLOC_MODELS` | `model.TestDecodeDoesNotAllocate` | comma-separated names or paths, each run beside the default | Llama-3.2-1B, olmoe and Qwen3.5-0.8B only |
| `JITLLM_SLOW` | several `model` sweeps | `1` admits models over 2 GiB | small models only |
| `JITLLM_STEP_DEVICES` | every `model` gate that sweeps backends (the step, scheduler, MLA, C6, vision, gpt-oss, Llama 4 and hybrid device gates, and the decode allocation gate) | comma-separated device specs, e.g. `cuda:0` | `cuda:0,vulkan:0,metal`; the allocation gate takes each backend's default device |
| `JITLLM_POSTNORM_MODELS` | `model.TestPostNormDeviceErrorIsAmplification` | comma-separated GGUF names in the directory, any model whose last block has a post-FFN norm | OLMo 2 1B and EXAONE 4.0 1.2B |
| `JITLLM_LLAMACPP_CPU` | `model.TestPostNormDeviceErrorIsAmplification` | a directory holding a CPU-only `llama-perplexity` and its libraries (a CUDA library beside it is loaded and used) | the test skips naming it |

Every other `JITLLM_*` variable a test reads is a knob or an opt-in for a
measurement, not a model choice.

## Choosing WHICH device

A gate that wants exactly one device names it with a selector: `gpu:0`,
`cuda:0`, `vulkan:1`. A bare `gpu`, `cuda` or `vulkan` is every device of that
backend (`tier.ParseDevices`), so on a box with eight cards it opens eight, and
on a laptop with a discrete card and an iGPU `gpu` and `vulkan` open both.

`jit/gpu/backend`'s tests open their devices through `backend.Open`, which
takes a discrete card before an integrated one -- so on a laptop with both, the
iGPU is never tested unless it is named. The test binary (not the package,
which reads no environment) maps these onto the `backend.Opts` `Open` uses:

| variable | effect | unset |
|---|---|---|
| `JITLLM_VK_DEVICE` | the Vulkan device every `backend.Open` takes, by index or name substring (`1` is the Iris Xe beside the RTX here) | the default rule's pick |
| `JITLLM_ROCM` | the ROCm library directory the HIP backend loads from (`backend`, `lowertest`, `hip` and `server` tests; `jitllm` and `jitllmd` too); with no AMD card, comgr alone runs the offline code object gate (docs/design/amd-hip.md) | the default search: the loader, `/opt/rocm/lib`, `/opt/rocm-*/lib` |
| `JITLLM_FOUR_DEVICES` | the four devices `model.TestSchedulerOnSplitPlacements*`'s four-device arms split the model over, as specs (`cuda:0,cuda:1,vulkan:2,vulkan:3`) | every CUDA device, then each Vulkan GPU that is not one of them (by UUID); fewer than four skips naming them |
| `JITLLM_PAGED_VK` | the Vulkan devices the paged-attention gates (`TestPaged*`) sweep, by index; `none` for no Vulkan | every Vulkan GPU, a software rasteriser (llvmpipe) left out |
| `JITLLM_VK_MAXGROUPS` | workgroups per Vulkan dispatch, below the device's own `maxComputeWorkGroupCount`; `7` sends nearly every launch in the suite through a split dispatch | the device's own |
| `JITLLM_VK_VALIDATION` | the prefix the Khronos validation layer is installed under, for `backend.TestSplitLaunchesAreValidVulkanUsage`; `apt-get download vulkan-validationlayers && dpkg-deb -x` the `.deb` into DIR and pass `DIR/usr` | `/usr`, else the test skips |

    JITLLM_VK_DEVICE=1 JITLLM_VK_MAXGROUPS=7 ./scripts/cap 8G -- go test ./jit/gpu/backend/ -count=1

The `model` device gates take the same limit, as `tier.WithVulkanMaxGroups`:
`JITLLM_VK_MAXGROUPS` reaches every tier the step gates
(`TestStepAcrossSessions*`, whose devices `JITLLM_STEP_DEVICES` names) and the
default-device gates open (`TestSchedulerOnDevice*`, `TestSlidingWindowRunsOnTheDevice`
and every other caller of `swaTier`), and `JITLLM_TEST_DEVICES` names the
default-device gates' device, as a `tier.WithDevices` spec:

    JITLLM_TEST_DEVICES=vulkan:1 JITLLM_VK_MAXGROUPS=7 ./scripts/cap 8G -- go test ./engine/model -run 'TestSchedulerOnDevice' -count=1

`cmd/jitllm` reads `JITLLM_VK_DEVICE` and `JITLLM_VK_MAXGROUPS` too, as
`tier.WithVulkanDevice` and `tier.WithVulkanMaxGroups`.

## Reference scripts

The scripts under `scripts/` that build fixtures and record goldens
(`*gold.py`, `*real.py`, the paging and three-way harnesses) find everything
through environment variables, read by `scripts/refenv.py` for the Python
ones. None has a default that names a machine; a script stops naming the
variable it needs and did not find.

| variable | what it is | read by |
|---|---|---|
| `JITLLM_HF_PY` | the python of a venv with CPU torch, transformers, tokenizers and safetensors (`scripts/hfgold.py` has the install lines); every `*gold.py` / `*real.py` runs under it: `$JITLLM_HF_PY scripts/c6gold.py` | how the scripts are run |
| `JITLLM_MODELS` | the model directory: where GGUFs, fixtures and checkpoints are read and written | every script |
| `LCPP_SRC` | a llama.cpp source checkout (`convert_hf_to_gguf.py`, `gguf-py`, `tools/mtmd/test-1.jpeg`) | the fixture builders |
| `JITLLM_LCPP` | a llama.cpp build directory (`llama-completion`, `llama-tokenize`, `libggml-base.so`) | `gold.py`, `rungold.py`, `tokgold.py`, `embedgold.py`, `vs-llamacpp*.sh` |
| `JITLLM_LLAMACPP_CPU` | a CPU-only llama.cpp build directory (`llama-mtmd-cli`, `llama-perplexity`) | `vlmgold.py`, `qwenvlmtmd.py`, and the post-norm gate above |
| `CV_TOK`, `CV_HF` | the family tokenizers the fixtures copy, and where their HuggingFace directories are written | default `$JITLLM_MODELS/tok` and `$JITLLM_MODELS/hf` |
| `BAILING_PY`, `BAILING_REF` | the python of a second venv with transformers 4.52.3, and inclusionAI's Ling 2.0 remote code | `moegold.py`'s `synth-bailingmoe2` only |
| `L4_TOK` | the directory holding Llama 4's `tokenizer.json` | `llama4gold.py`, `llama4visiongold.py` |

A script-specific override (`QVL_TOK`, `PIX_HF`, `PHI4V_TOK` and the like) is
named in that script's docstring and defaults to a path under `$JITLLM_MODELS`.
