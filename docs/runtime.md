# Runtime and project layout

[Back to the README](../README.md)

**An operating system for LLM inference.**

jitllm scans your hardware, decides where each block of a model runs across
every CPU core and GPU, generates the kernels for that hardware at run time,
and pages weights, experts and KV state through memory as demand changes.

- **Run models larger than memory.** Weights page from disk through RAM and
  VRAM, and a mixture of experts reads only the experts each token routes to.
- **Relocate at run time.** Blocks move between the CPU and GPUs while a model
  serves, and their attention and recurrent state move with them, so a
  conversation survives the move.
- **Long context on a paged KV cache.** The cache grows a page at a time, spills
  to a store and comes back, and reuses prompt prefixes that sessions share.
- **No cgo, no SDK.** One Go executable per platform. It finds the installed
  CUDA, Vulkan or Metal driver at run time and otherwise runs on the CPU.

Serve models through **OpenAI-compatible** chat, completion, model and embedding
endpoints or an **Anthropic-compatible** messages endpoint, with streaming and
tool calling. Models run from the `.jlm` container, which `jitllm convert`
writes once from GGUF or Hugging Face weights.

## The five principles

Every architecture, kernel and path keeps all five; each has a test that
enforces it.

| Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **JIT** | every kernel is emitted at run time for the device in front of it; the only assembly files are the Go-to-generated-code trampolines |
| **No Go compute** | no arithmetic a token runs is a Go loop; a missing optimised kernel is a basic generated kernel, never a fallback |
| **Relocation** | any block, its KV pages and its recurrent state can move host to device and between devices mid-sequence, with the same answer |
| **Paging** | paging is the design, not a mode: a model that does not fit pages, and a budget below the model evicts and re-reads with the same answer |
| **Low to no Go allocation** | a warm decode token makes zero engine heap allocations; weights and page frames live off the Go heap |

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S[GGUF / Hugging Face] --> C[Convert once]
    C --> M[.jlm container]
    M --> R[Runtime: paging, placement, tuning]
    R <--> CPU[CPU JIT: AVX2 / SSE / NEON]
    R <--> GPU[CUDA / Vulkan / Metal]
    R <--> K[KV store]
```

Kernels are specialised to the model's shapes and weight formats. On a GPU a
whole block (attention, norms, feed-forward, expert routing) runs in one
submission. Tuners measure kernel layouts, worker counts, prompt chunks and
matrix tiles on the machine; applications can override every choice through Go
options.

## Why Go?

Most inference engines are written in C, C++ or Rust, and some of the best work
is. The choice here is practical:

- **It is the language the author knows best for writing a JIT**: emitting
  machine code, mapping it executable and calling into it.
- **It is portable.** One toolchain cross-compiles every target, and with no cgo
  there is no C toolchain or vendor SDK per target.
- **It compiles fast, so experiments are fast.** Most of this engine was found
  by trying an idea and measuring it.

The hot paths are generated machine code either way; Go carries the parts around
them (paging, placement, scheduling).
