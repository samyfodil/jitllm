## ★ RULE 12r: THE 34x IS WEIGHT TRAFFIC, AND THE IR CANNOT EXPRESS THE TEXTBOOK FIX.

RULE 1d-duodecies measured device prefill at 0.0298 of llama.cpp; RULE 12u batched it and the row is 0.2431 now. The instinct is "batch the
submissions", and the numbers refuse it:

    device decode    160 tok/s  = 6.25 ms/token   reading 0.49 GB of weights
    device prefill   151 tok/s  = 6.6  ms/token   -- the SAME, because it IS decode, 507 times

**A token costs what a token costs, so the fix has to make one weight byte serve many tokens.**
Removing launches buys nothing when 6.6 ms of a 6.6 ms token is reading weights.

**★ AND A TILED GEMM IS NOT AVAILABLE: THIS IR HAS NEITHER SHARED MEMORY NOR A BARRIER.** The
classic answer stages a weight tile in shared memory for a whole thread block. `Reduce`'s own
comment records the constraint -- it exists as a second kernel "because this IR has neither shared
memory nor a barrier, and adding both to three backends to save one launch would be a poor trade".
That trade looks different now, but it is still three backends.

**So the reuse has to happen in REGISTERS: one thread takes one row and Tok token columns, loads
each weight word ONCE and issues Tok dot products.** Weight traffic falls by Tok. **That is the
CPU's interleave width (RULE 6) arrived at independently on the device, for the same reason and with
the same shape** -- and RULE 5b's warning travels with it: the best Tok on one thread is not the
best Tok at the real occupancy, so it is a measurement and not a constant.

**★ AND NTok REUSES THE MoE SLOT ADDRESSING RATHER THAN INVENTING ANY.** `SlotAct` already means
"each slot reads its OWN activation vector, laid out contiguously at stride K" -- which is exactly
what n token columns are. So a batched matvec is `Slots = NTok, SlotAct = true`, every offset is the
one RULE 14j already built and gated, and the only genuinely new thing is Tok. **The MoE work paid
for most of the prefill fix without knowing it.**

★ LANDED SO FAR: the shape (`NTok`, `Tok`), the refusals it cannot serve (experts, slots, split --
prefill has token parallelism and needs no split), and the guarantee that the DECODE kernel is
unchanged. At `Tok = 1` this is a correct batched launch that removes 507 submissions and does NOT
yet amortize weight traffic, which is the whole prize -- so expect nothing from it until Tok > 1,
and do not quote a prefill number before then.

## ★ RULE 12af: RULE 12x's CONTROL IS DEAD, AND THE K-QUANT FOLD IS BACK ON THE
TABLE. 46% OF THE MMA MATVEC IS THE FOLD AND 2.7% IS THE MATRIX INSTRUCTION.

**★ THE GPU PREFILL ROWS, RE-MEASURED AFTER 12y-12ae:**

    tinyllama q3_K_M   0.3666   REJECTED at IQR 0.119, CPU 841-2082 MHz
    gemma-2b           0.5689   IQR 0.045, 2 clamped samples discarded
                                (was 0.2678, measured at the 12u stage)

**gemma MORE THAN DOUBLED without a single gemma-specific change**, which is the
12y-12ae work carrying across. Both rows were taken with the package deep in RULE
2d's partial band and BOTH ARE PROVISIONAL -- but the ORDER is what matters and
the order inverted.

**★ AND THAT KILLS THE CONTROL RULE 12x CLOSED THE FOLD WITH.** 12x reads: "gemma-2b
is Q4_0 + Q8_0 and contains NO k-quants at all: tinyllama 0.2431, gemma 0.2678 --
10% apart. A model that cannot pay the k-quant fold is barely faster than one that
is 53% Q3_K, so whatever binds is common to both -- the GEMM's structure, not its
format. So porting the integer fold to the device was not expected to buy a row."

That was sound when the common bottleneck was dispatch and address arithmetic.
Those are gone (12z), and the two models are now **0.5689 against ~0.37 -- 55%
apart, and the k-quant model is the slow one.** Format is now the biggest single
term. **A control is only valid while the thing it controls for is still the
binding constraint.**

**★ THE SASS SAYS THE SAME THING WITHOUT ANY RATIO.** `jit/gpu/cmd/ptxdump` +
ptxas + cuobjdump, tinyllama's shipping prefill shape (Q3_K, k=2048, rows=5632,
NTok=128, MT=4, NT=4):

    mma-q3k   592 instructions        dp4a-q3k   872
      128 FFMA  |                       256 IDP
       72 I2FP  |- 272 = 46%            128 FFMA + 68 I2FP + 68 FMUL = 264 = 30%
       72 FMUL  |  the float fold       112 LDG
       64 STG  44 LDG  34 SHF           64 STG
       16 IMMA  <- 2.7%                 168 registers
      127 registers

**The matrix instruction is 2.7% of the kernel and the per-sub-block float fold
is 46%.** Every IMMA produces a complete integer dot product and the fold then
converts it, scales it and accumulates it -- once per (row, token, sub-block),
and Q3_K's sub-blocks are 16 elements where Q4_0's are 32, so it pays TWICE as
often. That is exactly the asymmetry the two rows now show.

**★ AND THE FIX MUST REMOVE WORK, NOT RELOCATE IT, BECAUSE 127 REGISTERS IS A
CLIFF.** RULE 12z built the integer fold, measured it at -25% AFTER the address
fix, and removed it: "the integer partial is a second accumulator array, 64 int32
beside 64 float, and ptxas reports 173 registers against 127 -- 10 warps to an SM
instead of 16. On this kernel OCCUPANCY BEATS INSTRUCTION COUNT." The kernel is
still at 127. So the direction is a CHEAPER fold at the same register count --
hoisting the activation scale per super-block the way RULE 6d did on the CPU is
the first candidate, since at window 256 one d_a covers the whole super-block and
the FMUL leaves the sub-block loop -- not a second accumulator array.

★ MEASURE THIS ON A RESTED BOX. Both rows above ran at 1034-2103 MHz with PSI at
0.00 and the die at 72 C -- idle, cool, and clamped, which is RULE 2d's
sustained-power limit and its exact signature: the package stops making heat
because it stopped working.


## ★ RULE 12ag: THE ZERO POINT MOVED ONTO THE WEIGHTS. 64 FFMA AND 8 LOADS GONE
PER SUB-BLOCK, AND THE REGISTER TRADE IS THE RIGHT WAY ROUND THIS TIME.

RULE 12af put 46% of the MMA matvec in the per-sub-block float fold and named the
d_a hoist as the fix. **That was wrong and the investigation is worth keeping**:
this kernel's sub-block loop is FLAT over all K (`super = subIdx >> log2(perSuper)`
is derived, not a loop level), so hoisting d_a needs `acc += d_a_super * inner`
and therefore a SECOND accumulator array -- the exact 64 registers that took RULE
12z's integer fold from 127 to 173 and cost it 25%.

Three other routes are closed too, each for its own reason: folding
`scale[x]*da[y]` into one multiplier is bijective over the 64 outputs and buys no
reuse; covering two Q3_K sub-blocks in one m16n8k32 is RULE 12y's own refusal,
since they carry different scales; and the stores are 64 of 592 but execute ONCE
against a loop that runs 128 times, so the static histogram UNDERSTATES the
fold's share rather than overstating it.

**★ WHAT WORKS IS CENTERING THE WEIGHTS, AND THE BORROW PROBLEM HAS A TWO-OP
ANSWER.** A packed quant is unsigned -- Q4_0 0..15, Q3_K 0..7, Q6_K 0..63 -- and
the true weight is `q - biasK`. That correction rode the ACTIVATION side as
`-biasK*sumA[y]`, one Fma per output element per sub-block, 64 per iteration at
the shipping tile. Subtracting biasK from the packed bytes instead makes the
fragment hold the true signed weight, and mma's A operand is already s8.

A plain per-byte subtract BORROWS across lanes whenever `q < biasK`. This does
not:

	centered = (q + (0x80 - biasK) broadcast) ^ 0x80808080

Every byte lands in `[0x80-biasK, 0x80-biasK+qmax]` -- 131 for Q3_K, 135 for
Q4_0, 159 for Q6_K, **all under 256, so no byte carries into its neighbour** --
and the XOR then flips the bias away, mapping `[0x80-biasK, 0x7F]` to
`[-biasK, -1]` and `[0x80, ...]` to `[0, qmax-biasK]`. Exact, two instructions,
and it applies to every constant-bias format from one constant.

    SASS, tinyllama's shipping prefill shape (Q3_K, k=2048, rows=5632, ntok=128, 4x4)
      FFMA   128 -> 64     the bias correction, gone
      LDG     44 -> 36     the sumA loads, gone with it
      total  592 -> 528    -10.8% static, and MORE dynamically: every removed
                           FFMA is inside the loop, while the 64 STG that dilute
                           the static count run once
      registers 127 -> 128 -- sm_86 allocates at a granularity of 8, so both
                           round to 128 and occupancy does not move

**★ AND IT REMOVES LIVE STATE RATHER THAN ADDING IT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE
DIFFERENCE FROM RULE 12z.** The eight `sumA` values are no longer loaded or held;
the add/XOR overwrite the fragment register, whose uncentered value has no later
use. The integer fold failed because it wanted a second array resident; this
wants one fewer.

★ `ir.OpXor` IS THE ONE NEW IR OP, AND IT EARNS ITS PLACE ON ARITHMETIC RATHER
THAN ON TASTE: `xor.b32`, `OpBitwiseXor`, `^`. No `prmt`, no `lop3`, no packed
video subtract -- a general packed-subtract op would carry semantics nothing
needs, and PTX's `vsub4` is not a guarantee of one native instruction anyway.

★ GATED BY BIT EQUALITY AGAINST THE dp4a KERNEL, which is the sharp gate RULE 12y
built: 147 subtests, Q3_K/Q4_0/Q6_K/Q8_0 at win32 and win256 including the
shipping 5632x2048 shape, 0 FAIL. Run against three violations: the add without
the XOR fails, a bias off by one fails, and centering Q8_0 -- which is already
signed -- fails. `verify -prefill` is 0/10 with max|dlogit| 0 on the MoE and its
per-token control is 0 everywhere.

★ NO RATE WAS CLAIMED WHEN THIS WAS WRITTEN. The box was in RULE 2d's
sustained-power clamp (PSI 0.00, 72 C, 1034 MHz idle), so nothing timed that day
was valid, and the instruction and register counts above are exact and need no
quiet box.

**★ IT IS 1.066 ON THE ROW, MEASURED RESTED, AND THE SWITCH THAT MADE IT
MEASURABLE IS THE PART TO KEEP.** `JITLLM_NO_CENTER` disables the centering in
BOTH kernels, so the two arms run in ONE session against one llama.cpp -- which
is RULE 1d-undecies' requirement, not a convenience: a pre-change baseline
carried across days moved a prefill row 2.7 points on its own, survived the IQR
gate, and was the difference between "2.5% from a win" and "at parity".
tinyllama GPU prefill, direct jitllm-against-jitllm ABBA:

    round 1   DISCARDED -- 470 then 1039 tok/s, RULE 2a cold start
    round 2   1.0658
    round 3   1.0569
    round 4   1.0775
    median 1.066, spread 0.021

**And the llama.cpp arms of the same session corroborate it independently**:
0.4383 centered against 0.4134 uncentered is 1.060, from a ratio that divides
out the other engine entirely. Two routes to the same number, one of them
immune to whatever llama.cpp was doing that afternoon.

**★ 12ag-bis. THE SAME CENTERING IN THE dp4a KERNEL, AND IT IS A REGRESSION FOR
DECODE UNLESS IT IS GATED ON Tok.** The dp4a matvec has the same fold and is the
wider target: Metal and Vulkan have no matrix instruction, and DECODE uses this
kernel on every backend. The ratio there looked better still, because `lo` and
`hi` are unpacked once per (word, row) and feed all Tok token columns while the
Fma removed is per (row, TOKEN).

**That same asymmetry is what makes it a LOSS at small Tok.** Counted in SASS,
Q3_K 5632x2048, centered against not:

    Tok      1     2     4     8    16
    delta   +8   +16    +8   -16   -48        Q4_0 measures the same shape

**Decode is Tok=1.** An ungated version would have made every decode kernel on
every backend eight instructions longer in order to speed up prefill -- RULE 5b's
"measure the configuration that ships, not the one that isolates cleanly" and
RULE 6a's "a below-bar measurement rejects the change AS MEASURED", both in one
change. `centered` now carries `&& s.Tok >= 8`, so decode kernels are
byte-identical -- `TestDenseKernelsUnchanged` passes against the ORIGINAL hashes,
which is the proof -- and prefill at Tok=16 reads 872 -> 824.

★ AND ONE OF THE TWO VIOLATIONS I RAN WAS VACUOUS, WHICH IS WORTH KNOWING.
Forcing `centered` on for the biasArray formats PASSED, and not because the guard
is unnecessary: at biasK == 0 the sequence is `(v + 0x80808080) ^ 0x80808080`,
which for bytes 0..15 is the IDENTITY. A mutation that changes nothing is not a
violation, and it looks exactly like a passing one. The meaningful violations --
a bias off by one, and centering the weights while KEEPING the activation-side
Fma so the correction is applied twice -- both fail.


**★ 12ag-ter. THE dp4a CENTERING HAD NO HARDWARE GATE ON ANY BACKEND, AND THE
GREEN SUITE ON THREE HOSTS SAID OTHERWISE. RULE 14r FOR THE SEVENTH TIME.**

12ag-bis gates centering on `s.Tok >= 8`. Every hardware test that touches the
dp4a matvec ran BELOW that line:

    TestMatVecMatchesReference   swept Tok {1, 2, 4}   -> the !centered branch, always
                                 formats Q4_0/Q8_0/Q4_K only
    TestMatVecMMAMatchesDot4     its dp4a arm is Tok=1 -> also uncentered, and it
                                 SKIPS the whole case when MMA declines

So 12ag's "147 subtests, 0 FAIL" gated the MMA kernel -- a DIFFERENT kernel,
CUDA-only, which centers unconditionally. **The kernel Metal and Vulkan run for
every prefill matvec at the shipped `BatchTok = 16` had never been executed with
centering on, anywhere.** The Q3_K case is the one that matters: it is 53% of a
tinyllama and it carries the 1.066 row above.

**THE GATE IS Tok=1 AGAINST Tok>=8, BIT-IDENTICAL.** No float64 oracle is needed
and that is why it is cheap: Tok changes only how many token columns a thread
carries, never the summation order within a column, and the centered dot IS the
corrected dot. Bit equality is therefore the right bar, and building weights for
all six formats was already done in `mmamv_test.go`. Two changes: a declined
MMA records a reason instead of skipping the case, and Tok 8 and 16 run before
it. Run against a violation (`0x80 - biasK + 1`) on all three backends:

    ptx    NMSE 2.404e-02    spirv  NMSE 2.420e-02    msl  NMSE 2.404e-02
    correct: exact on every centered format, every backend, 0 elements differ

**★ AND IT FOUND SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ABOUT CENTERING: Q4_K AND Q5_K ARE NOT
Tok-INVARIANT ON SPIR-V.** Both are `biasArray` formats, so `centered` is false
for them at every Tok -- and Tok=1 against Tok=8 still disagrees on ~40% of
elements, worst |delta| 6.1e-05, on spirv only. **PTX and MSL are exact on the
same shapes.** Tiny and one-backend, so it reads as a reassociation in the min
term's fold rather than a wrong answer, and the gate bounds it (NMSE < 1e-8)
instead of excusing it. **UNDIAGNOSED.** Whoever picks it up: it is the min term
(`-dmin*m[s]*sum(a)`) and the SPIR-V lowering is the only variable.

**★ THREE THINGS A REVIEW CORRECTED, AND TWO ARE MINE TO OWN.**

1. **Q4_0's centered byte tops out at 135, not 139** -- `128 - 8 + 15`. Written
   139 here and in `mma.go`. The carry proof is unchanged (all three are under
   256) but a bound quoted wrong is a bound nobody can check.
2. **"a regression for decode" EXCEEDS THE EVIDENCE.** The `Tok >= 8` threshold
   rests on a static SASS delta (+8 at Tok=1) on ONE vendor. **RULE 5z is this
   project's own finding that a static count is not a share of the token**, and
   12ag-bis quotes RULE 5b and 6a while doing exactly what 5z forbids. Keep 8 as
   the conservative default and label it what it is: **unvalidated on Metal and
   Vulkan.** Eligibility (constant non-zero bias, byte range) is correctness and
   belongs in the kernel; profitability is a per-target policy and does not.
3. **`JITLLM_NO_CENTER` CANNOT RUN THE DECODE EXPERIMENT**, which I would have
   discovered by running it: at Tok=1 both arms generate the uncentered path, so
   the switch toggles nothing there. It also reads the env at package init, so
   it cannot be flipped inside a running process. Testing decode centering needs
   a force-ON below the threshold, which does not exist.

**★ 12ag-quater. THE THRESHOLD IS MEASURED NOW, NOT COUNTED -- AND THE SECOND
LEVER WAS PRICED AND IS DEAD. BOTH ANSWERS COST ONE AFTERNOON AND SAVED A DAY.**

12ag-ter left `Tok >= 8` resting on a static SASS delta and said so. It is a
POLICY, not a correctness condition, so the predicate is split: `eligible` is
the constant non-zero bias whose centered bytes cannot carry, and
`centerMinTok` (JITLLM_CENTER_MINTOK, default 8) is the break-even. **That split
is what makes the decode question askable at all** -- at the shipped 8 both arms
of any A/B generate the uncentered kernel at Tok=1, so the switch that exists
could not run the experiment, which a review pointed out and which one attempt
would have shown.

Correctness first: with centering forced to Tok=1, `TestMatVecMatchesReference`
passes against the float64 reference on ptx, spirv AND msl, and the same run
against the bias-off-by-one violation fails 82 subtests. **The decode path is
CORRECT when centered; the only question was ever whether it pays.**

    tinyllama, decode n=96, cross-process ABBA, ON = centered at Tok=1
      CUDA    per-round 0.9738 0.9765 0.9854 0.9882   median 0.981   4/4 agree
      Metal   per-round 0.9936 1.0105 0.9953 0.9822   median 0.994   3/4
      Metal A/A SELF-CONTROL, run FIRST   113.64-119.11, spread 4.8%

**ON NVIDIA THE EXCLUSION IS EARNED: a consistent 1.9% loss, every round in the
same direction.** The static count predicted the sign correctly and is now
retired in favour of the measurement.

**ON METAL IT IS NEUTRAL AND THE ROW IS UNRESOLVED, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS
CONFIRMED.** 0.994 sits well inside a 4.8% self-control, so this harness cannot
tell a 1% regression from a 1% win there, and n=96 cross-process is the reason.
**Keeping 8 is still right** -- it avoids a measured loss on one backend and
costs nothing detectable on the other -- but the honest label is "measured on
CUDA, indistinguishable from zero on Metal", not "validated".

★ AND THE SELF-CONTROL RAN FIRST THIS TIME, which RULE 5ac demands and which
every earlier Mac A/B in this file skipped. It is what turns 0.994 from a result
into a non-result, and that is the whole reason to run it.

**★ AND THE SUM-FREE QUANTIZER IS PRICED AT <=0.5% OF A PREFILL TOKEN.** It was
the first-ranked companion lever below, and RULE 5z says to
price a removal against the TOKEN before building it. `JITLLM_GPU_SKIP=quant`
already removes the WHOLE quantize kernel:

    tinyllama GPU prefill, rounds 2-3 (round 1 discarded, RULE 2a cold start)
      quantize ON    1938, 1844 tok/s
      quantize OFF   1938, 1928        -- ~2%, and inside the arm's own 5% spread

**The entire kernel is worth about 2% and the sums are 32 Add + 2 CvtF32 + 2
Store out of ~200 IR ops in it, so the lever's ceiling is ~0.4% of a token.**

★★ AND THE FIRST VERDICT WRITTEN HERE, "DO NOT BUILD IT", WAS THE WRONG ONE, WHICH A REVIEW CALLED THE
CLEAREST SURVIVING VIOLATION OF RULE 6-0 -- in a paragraph written the same day
6-0 was. **Size is not a refusal.** What the 0.4% establishes is ORDER: this goes
after the 8% fusion work and after the MoE dispatch batching, not that it is
forbidden. Two honest caveats on the number itself, also the review's: the ~0.4%
multiplies an UNRESOLVED skip result (the 2% sits inside the arm's own 5% spread)
by a static IR-op fraction, so it is an estimate of an estimate. What can be said
without either is that the change removes real work and cannot be SHOWN to help
on this harness -- so build it if it is cheap and correct, and do not put a perf
claim on it.
That leaves the MMA lifetime work and the Q6_K upload precenter below as the
surviving candidates, neither of them priced yet.

**★ AND THE SECOND LEVER, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH MORE THAN THE 1.066.**
Centering deleted the CONSUMER of the activation sums. **`emitQuant` in
`kernels/elem.go` still PRODUCES them** -- two integer half-sum chains,
converted and stored, every quantize, for consumers that no longer read them.
Deleting a consumer cannot remove work across a kernel boundary, so a sum-free
quantizer variant is a dependency removal that was impossible before centering
and is worth nothing without it. It is per-BUFFER, not per-model: Q4_K/Q5_K and
any uncentered constant-bias path still read the sums, so a mixed model cannot
delete them wholesale. Two more, in order:

  - **MMA lifetime scheduling BEFORE any wider tile.** The registers went 127 ->
    128 despite eight sum values disappearing, so deleted source state did not
    become allocated headroom; the loop builds all weight fragments, then all
    activation fragments, then scales. Consuming one weight-row tile across the
    token tiles and retiring it is the candidate. Widening Rowt*Tok first cannot
    pay -- roughly Tok deleted sums against doubled output accumulators.
  - **PRECENTER Q6_K AT UPLOAD.** It already occupies full bytes in the packed
    layout, so storing signed `q-32` once removes BOTH the runtime centering and
    the sum correction, with no payload expansion, **at every Tok including 1**.
    It does not transfer to Q3_K/Q4_0, whose values still need sign extension
    after the nibble extract. It needs a layout contract across every consumer.

★ AND A REVIEW FOUND THE SEQUENCE. I had ruled the weight-side correction out for
want of a borrow-free SWAR and asked the reviewer specifically whether I was wrong about
that. It was also right that `Builder.Done` does no dead-code elimination, so the
now-unused sumA loads had to be removed explicitly rather than left to the
lowerer -- eight loads per sub-block that would otherwise still be emitted.


## ★ RULE 12s: THE IR HAS SHARED MEMORY AND A BARRIER NOW, AND THE "NOT GETTING" COMMENT WAS ROT.

`ir.Shared(name, elem, n)` and `ir.Barrier()`, lowered on all three backends:

    PTX      a kernel-scope `.shared .align N .b8` array, cvta'd to generic; `bar.sync 0`
    SPIR-V   a module-scope OpVariable in the Workgroup class over an OpTypeArray;
             OpControlBarrier(Workgroup, Workgroup, AcquireRelease|WorkgroupMemory)
    MSL      `threadgroup T name[N]`; threadgroup_barrier(mem_flags::mem_threadgroup)

**★ THE IR SAID IT WAS "NOT GETTING" THESE, IN SO MANY WORDS.** OpShuffleXor's comment read: "a
reduction otherwise costs a second kernel ... a tree reduction wanted shared memory and a barrier,
neither of which this IR has and neither of which it is getting". That was RIGHT when written -- the
only customer was a softmax reduction and a butterfly shuffle bought it without touching three
backends. What changed is a measurement: RULE 1d-duodecies put device PREFILL at 0.0298 because
every weight is re-read per token, and the fix is a tiled GEMM, which stages a weight tile for a
whole thread block and cannot be written with shuffles. **RULE 15f again -- a comment explaining why
something is NOT done is a claim about the code, and it rots when the numbers move.**

**★ THREE PLACES IT DIFFERS FROM A BUFFER, AND EACH WOULD HAVE BEEN A SILENT BUG:**

  1. **The access chain has a DIFFERENT ARITY.** A StorageBuffer parameter is a struct wrapping a
     runtime array, so its chain is (member 0, element); a Workgroup array is the array itself, so
     it is (element). Using the buffer form indexes past the array.
  2. **A pointer's storage class is part of its TYPE**, so shared needs its own pointer types.
     Reusing the StorageBuffer ones is not a mismatch anything forgives.
  3. **PTX declares shared state at KERNEL SCOPE**, not inline, so `Buf` grew a declaration block.
     MSL allows an inline `threadgroup` declaration but one inside a loop body is a fresh object
     per iteration on some compilers -- so OpShared must precede any loop, on every target.

**★ AND spirv-val WAS ON THIS BOX ALL ALONG, JUST NOT ON $PATH.** `lowertest` logged "spirv-val not
installed: SPIR-V is lowered but not validated" on every run while the binary sat in a snap. **A
validator that is present and unused is worse than one that is absent, because the log line reads
the same either way** -- and this is the file RULE 12e wrote specifically to close that gap,
reopened by a PATH. It now looks in the snap paths too, and every kernel in the tree validates.

★ RUN AGAINST VIOLATIONS: the wrong access-chain arity is caught -- "OpAccessChain reached
non-composite type while indexes still remain to be traversed". **Dropping the barrier's memory
SEMANTICS (0x108 -> 0) is NOT caught**, and that is the honest limit of this gate: spirv-val
validates STRUCTURE, not memory ordering. A barrier that synchronises execution and orders nothing
assembles cleanly and races on hardware. Only a real device and a real race can see that one.

## ★ RULE 12t: THE BATCHED MATVEC IS CORRECT. ONE LINE ERASED THE WHOLE MAPPING, AND A REVIEW FOUND IT.

`NTok` (token columns per launch) and `Tok` (columns per THREAD, the weight reuse of RULE 12r) now
match the float64 reference on hardware at Tok = 1, 2 and 4 across every shape, and `Tok == 1` is
byte-identical to the decode kernel.

**★ THE BUG WAS THREE WORDS, AND I HAD STARED PAST IT.** `MatVec` maps a token batch onto the MoE
slot machinery -- `Slots = NTok, SlotAct = true` -- and eleven lines later:

    if experts == 1 { slots = 1 }

**Slots means "expert slots" to the MoE caller, so a dense launch resets it.** A token batch sets
Slots = NTok with Experts = 1, and the reset put it straight back to 1: the thread clamp became
Rows-1, `slotAct` went false so no per-token base was ever added, `sumOff` became nb where the
buffer holds NTok*nb of scales first (so Q4_0 read other tokens' SCALES as its sums), and only
column 0 was ever written. Four silent failures from one assignment.

**★ AND IT FALSIFIES RULE 12r's CENTRAL CLAIM, WHICH I SHOULD RECORD RATHER THAN QUIETLY FIX.**
12r says "NTok reuses the MoE slot addressing that RULE 14j already gated ... the MoE work paid for
most of the prefill fix without knowing it". The LAYOUT reuse was sound -- the review confirmed the
activation packing, the pAX scales-then-sums order and the output slot stride all match what `mvid`
produces. What was NOT reusable was the NORMALISATION and the THREAD GEOMETRY around it.
**Reusing tested addressing is not the same as reusing it correctly.**

Two more, both real and both invisible at Tok = 1:

  - **The grid decoded one token per thread.** With Tok > 1 a thread owns a token GROUP, so the
    clamp is Rows*(NTok/Tok)-1 and the group's first token is (flat/Rows)*Tok. The old expression
    let groups overlap each other's ranges.
  - **Only `accs[0]` was stored.** The Tok loops filled all of them; columns 1..Tok-1 kept whatever
    the buffer held, which is unspecified and NOT zero -- plausible garbage rather than a hole.

★ THE REVIEW ALSO FOUND TWO DEFECTS OUTSIDE THE SHAPE, AND THE FIRST IS THE MORE ALARMING:

  1. **PTX emitted `ld.global` on a SHARED address.** RULE 12s cvta'd the shared symbol to generic
     and left the loads global-qualified; ptxas ACCEPTS that and it reads the wrong address space on
     hardware. **The assembler gate cannot see it** -- `shared/roundtrip` assembled on all three
     backends while being wrong on one, because it was never EXECUTED. Fixed by keeping the address
     in the shared space and emitting `ld.shared`/`st.shared`.
  2. **`ir.Validate` did not check what two lowerers' comments said it checked.** Both claimed it
     enforced OpShared-before-any-loop. It enforced nothing. RULE 15f, written by the same hand in
     the same hour as the code it lied about. The check exists now.

★ AND THE TEST LAUNCHED 64 THREADS AT A 128-WIDE KERNEL. PTX reads `%ntid.x` at runtime so it was
invisible there; Metal BAKES the width and would skip rows, Vulkan ignores it and over-launches.
Three backends, three different wrong answers from one hardcoded constant. It uses `kk.Group[0]`.

★ THE VALUE OF THE SECOND OPINION, MEASURED: I had localised the fault correctly (Tok=1 failing
means the mapping, not the registers) and then looked for it in the addressing I had WRITTEN rather
than in the normalisation I had INHERITED. RULE 12i recorded the same shape -- "the value was not
GPU expertise; it was that it had no stake in the theory being defended".

★ STILL UNMOVED: the 34x. Correct is not fast -- nothing yet CALLS the batched kernel, so device
prefill is 0.2431 now (RULE 1d-terdecies); `Layers` is wired to it. The number
does not change until then.

## ★ RULE 12: the GPU tier runs WHOLE BLOCKS, and the win was the submission, not the kernels.

Serving one matvec at a time cost a blocking round trip per matvec -- ~59 us across the 127 a gemma
token issues, 7.5 ms of a 29 ms token, against llama.cpp's 14.7 ms for the entire token. `nn.LayerDevice`
moves the unit to a transformer BLOCK: every op between the matvecs (RMSNorm, quantize, RoPE, the KV
copy, scores, softmax, the weighted sum, the FFN gate, the residual add) is a generated kernel, so the
residual stream never returns to the host inside a block.

A block, not a token, for two reasons. The device never learns what a transformer is beyond one
repeating unit -- `engine/model/` keeps the graph, and nothing in `jit/gpu` knows about embedding lookup,
sampling or tied output weights. And **the CPU/GPU split falls out for free**: `PrepLayer` is per
block and may decline, so a model too big for the card runs its first N blocks on the device and the
rest on the CPU, with no separate placement policy. On a 4 GB card that is the difference between
running and not.

★ THAT SPLIT WAS A CORRECTNESS WIN AND A SPEED LOSS FOR AS LONG AS IT EXISTED, AND RULE 15g IS THE
FIX. The blocks the placement did NOT take went through `GPU.MatVec` one matvec at a time, which is
the cost this rule's own first paragraph is about -- so "the rest runs on the CPU" was true about the
weights and false about the speed, and every partial seam measured BELOW the CPU tier.

Measured on an RTX 3050 Ti Laptop, CUDA, `-n 32` after 8 warmup tokens, median of five:

    model        jitllm CPU   jitllm GPU   llama.cpp CUDA   ratio
    tinyllama      70.8     130.9        128.18       1.02x
    gemma-2b       26.5      69.6         79.06       0.88x

**All 32 greedy token IDs are identical to the float64 CPU path on both models.** The residual stream
is float32 on the device and float64 on the host, so agreement was expected to be NMSE rather than
exact, and it is exact. That is worth more than the rate: it makes the CPU tier a real oracle, and any
kernel change that shifts a token ID is a bug until proven otherwise.

**★ 12a. A SINGLE GPU RUN CANNOT SEE A 5% CHANGE, AND THREE CLAIMS WERE MADE ON ONE ANYWAY.** Five
identical gemma runs read 64.58, 68.14, 69.63, 69.83 and 73.33 tok/s -- a 13% spread. `jitllm-gpu -ab`
alternates two arms inside ONE process, on one State and one copy of the device weights, and reports
the median of per-round ratios with RULE 2's IQR gate. Every arm is a FIELD on the tier rather than an
env var, so both configurations are compiled and resident at once and nothing reloads between rounds.
That drops the spread to 2.5-5.9%.

**★ 12b. THREAD COUNT BEATS LAUNCH COUNT AND MEMORY TRAFFIC, WHICH COUNTING LAUNCHES DOES NOT
PREDICT.** A launch costs 2.6 us here and a decode block issues ~25 of them, 18 blocks per token, so
~1.2 ms of a 13.7 ms token is launch overhead. Fusing NormApply into Quantize, the residual add into
the next norm's partial sums, and the FFN gate into its quantization removes seven launches per block
and 128 KB of traffic -- and measures **0.9910x**. Quantization needs a thread per 32-element block,
so the fused kernel runs 64 threads where NormApply ran 2048, and on this device that trade loses.
Kernel fusion as a launch-count argument was tried and measured: 0.9910x.

**★ 12c. THE "SMALL MATVECS ARE SLOW" TABLE WAS A HARNESS ARTIFACT, AND IT SENT ME AFTER THE WRONG
THING FOR HALF A DAY.** cmd/mvbench timed each shape with `backend.Kernel.Launch`, which
SYNCHRONISES: on CUDA that is an ownership hop plus `cuLaunchKernel` plus `cuCtxSynchronize`, and for
`split > 1` the sample paid it TWICE. One timing sample was one launch plus one full device drain,
against a k/v matvec whose entire weight traffic is 0.3 MB. Timed instead through a `Session` with
many launches and ONE `Sync` -- the shape `tier.timeSplit` already used -- the same card, same
kernels, same day:

    shape                       was    now   of wall   what changed
    k/v      256x2048  0.3 MB    12     74     49%     6.2x
    q/o     2048x2048  2.4 MB    62    131     85%     2.1x
    qkv fused 2560     2.9 MB    73    133     87%

    read wall 153.1 GB/s, launch floor 2.37 us through one Session

**q/o was never at 42% of the wall; it is at 85%.** k/v is the only shape still low, and 0.3 MB at
74 GB/s is 4 us against a 2.37 us launch floor -- roughly 40% of its time IS the floor, so it cannot
be priced in isolation at all and no kernel change will move it.

Everything above the wall says the `Stream` probe understates it, the way `bench.MemWall` does on the
CPU (RULE 8b). Treat 153 as a lower bound.

★ THE REUSABLE PART IS THAT THE A/B ALREADY KNEW. RULE 12a records q|k|v fusion at 1.0072x and the
measured split at 1.0021x on gemma, both far under what the isolated table predicted, and I read them
as puzzles. A fixed per-launch cost of ~19 us in the isolated measurement and ~0 in the real async
stream predicts exactly that discrepancy. **When an end-to-end A/B and an isolated microbenchmark
disagree by a factor, suspect the microbenchmark** -- RULE 11 says measure the harness before the
code it runs, and this is the third time in this file that a "slow kernel" turned out to be the thing
timing it.

q, k and v read the same activation vector, so packing them as one 2560-row matrix and running one
matvec is still the obvious fix for k/v, and it is still not worth it: end to end it measured
1.0072x, because q, k and v are 5.3 MB of the 61.9 MB a gemma block reads. Removed -- it needed a
second residency map and a source offset baked into RoPE and CopyAt, which meant whether a model
fuses had to be settled by its first block and held for every later one. A correctness hazard for
0.7%.

**★ 12d. NO KERNEL MAY READ A BUFFER IT WRITES, AND `ir.Validate` NOW REFUSES IT.** The IR has no
conditional execution outside a loop, so surplus threads are CLAMPED to the last work item rather
than branched off. That is benign exactly when the result is a pure function of read-only inputs.
An in-place RoPE re-rotated the last head and an in-place softmax re-normalised the last row, once
per surplus thread -- both produced correct numbers in every head but the LAST, which is the one the
clamp piles onto, so a spot check of head 0 passes and the failure reads like a GQA indexing bug.
Aliasing is a property of the ops, so it is checked rather than remembered.

**★ 12e. `jit/gpu/lowertest` ASSEMBLES EVERY SHIPPED KERNEL WITH THE VENDORS' OWN TOOLS.** PTX
refuses a divide with no rounding modifier, and nothing caught `div.f32` until a kernel that divides
reached real hardware, where the entire symptom was `CUresult=218`, "a PTX JIT compilation failed",
with no line number. The lowerers had unit tests for the ops they knew about; what was missing was a
gate that asks `ptxas` and `spirv-val` about the REAL kernels.

**★ 12f. A NESTED `LockOSThread` CORRUPTED THREAD CREATION FOR THE WHOLE PROCESS, AND THE CRASH
LANDED NOWHERE NEAR IT.** The symptom was "gemma segfaults on the Vulkan backend" -- during a
PURE-CPU decode, with the Vulkan device merely open and never called, flaky at about one run in two,
identical at every VRAM budget and memory cap, and reproducing back to `f9ab176`.

`cuda.Open` locks its OS thread, and `backend.openCUDA`'s owner goroutine locks it AGAIN while
deferring only one unlock. The count went 2 -> 1, so the owner exited STILL LOCKED. Go destroys the
thread of a goroutine that exits locked, using a raw exit that skips glibc's thread teardown -- and
with goffi's `fakecgo` in the process that thread is a real pthread, so it was left half-dismantled
and took out the NEXT thread the runtime created, inside `fakecgo`'s `threadentry`, jumping to an
address belonging to nothing.

Two things made it look like a GPU bug when it is a threading bug. It needs TWO backends: `Open()`
starts all of them and the tier keeps one, so asking for Vulkan opens CUDA and immediately closes
it -- a machine with one API, or a process that never closes a device, never sees it. And nothing in
the trace mentions CUDA, because by then the context is long gone.

Fixed by matching the lock (`cuda.Device.Close` destroys the context and unlocks) and by destroying
the context ON THE OWNER GOROUTINE before releasing it. `TestCloseThenSpawnThreads` opens every
backend, closes them, then forces the runtime to build 64 threads; it segfaults without the fix.

**The reusable part: a stack trace through `fakecgo`'s `threadentry` means a Go M, not a
driver-spawned thread.** That is what said to look at thread lifecycle rather than at Vulkan.

**★ 12g. VULKAN CALLED `vkQueueWaitIdle` ON EVERY DISPATCH, AND THAT WAS MOST OF WHY IT LOOKED
SLOW.** `vkDev.Session` was `f(directSession{})`, so each launch went to `Kernel.Launch`: reset the
command buffer, record one dispatch, submit, drain the queue. A decode token issues ~450 launches, so
it paid ~450 full drains. Metal already had the fix -- one command buffer per SESSION, citing 288.8
us per dispatch -- and CUDA never needed it because its launches are asynchronous. Vulkan was the arm
still doing it per dispatch, and nobody had looked.

    tinyllama, Vulkan, same card, same binary otherwise
    per-dispatch submit   30.9 tok/s
    one command buffer   101.1 tok/s      3.3x

Two things Vulkan needs that Metal does not. **A BARRIER BETWEEN DISPATCHES**: Vulkan does not order
compute dispatches within a command buffer the way a CUDA stream orders launches, so without an
explicit dependency the second may read what the first has not finished writing. Every kernel in a
block consumes the previous one's output, so each encode ends with a whole-pipeline
shader-write-to-shader-read barrier -- the conservative one on purpose, because the precise one needs
to know which buffers alias and being wrong is a race rather than an error. And **A DESCRIPTOR SET
PER DISPATCH**: `Kernel.Bind` updates the ONE set a kernel owns, which was correct only because
Launch submitted immediately; jitllm encodes its quantize kernel 54 times a token against different
sources, so batched they would all have run with the last binding. Sets now come from a per-Ctx pool
the commit resets.

**★ 12h. "OVER BUDGET" AND "THE DEVICE REFUSED" ARE OPPOSITE FACTS AND WERE ONE COUNTER.** gemma read
44 tok/s instead of 70 and the report said "1 tensors over budget" -- with `-vram` at 4 GB and 1.04
GiB resident, which cannot be a budget decision. Another process held 1262 MiB of the 4 GB card, so
lm_head's 557 MB allocation failed and the largest matvec of the token moved silently to the CPU.
`NoRoom` is now separate from `Declined`, and jitllm-gpu says the number is not comparable with a run
that had the card to itself. Over budget is a choice jitllm made; out of memory is the card being full.

Vulkan is still behind CUDA here (gemma 39.5 vs 44.9, tinyllama 101 vs 129, both under that VRAM
contention) and the API tuner duly picks PTX. Both backends produce token IDs identical to the CPU
path on every model.

**★ 12i. THE METAL SOFTMAX BUG DID NOT EXIST. `jitllm verify` DIFFED TWO AUTOREGRESSIVE CHAINS.**

The warp softmax -- one 32-lane subgroup per head, butterfly reduction, worth 8.4% on CUDA -- was
gated off on Metal for weeks on this evidence: tinyllama (nHead 32) produced **32 wrong tokens out of
32** there, while gemma (nHead 8) was perfect and CUDA was perfect at both. A standalone probe of the
same kernel, same nHead, same maxSeq, passed at n = 1, 2, 31, 32, 33 and 37. That gap between "passes
alone, fails in the chain" is what made it look like a subgroup-execution bug, and a long list of
things was ruled out: the encoder is `MTLDispatchTypeSerial`, buffers are `storageModeShared` with
tracked hazards, every dispatch sets its own pipeline and buffers.

**`benchRun` ran each tier as its OWN free-running greedy chain.** Both started from token 1 and each
fed its own argmax back in, after eight warm-up tokens that were generated and DISCARDED. So one
argmax flip anywhere -- including inside the discarded eight -- gave the two tiers different inputs
from that point on, and every id downstream differed. "32/32" was not 32 failures. It was one, and it
was invisible.

Teacher-forcing both tiers from a single token stream and comparing per position:

    Metal tinyllama  warp softmax    1/32 positions   margins 0.075 vs 0.021   max|dlogit| 0.43
    Metal tinyllama  SCALAR softmax  1/32 positions   margins 0.009 vs 0.028   max|dlogit| 0.42
    Metal gemma      warp softmax    0/32                                      max|dlogit| 1.58
    CUDA  tinyllama  warp softmax    0/32                                      max|dlogit| 0.30

**The scalar kernel disagrees just as often**, at a different position. Both are measuring the same
thing: the device tier is float32 and the reference float64, `max|dlogit|` is ~0.3 on the CUDA row
that PASSES, and tinyllama has argmax margins smaller than that. The softmax was never the variable.
The gate is removed; warp is the default on all three backends.

Three things to keep.

1. **A comparison of two autoregressive chains cannot localise anything.** The first disagreement
   destroys the inputs of every later one, so the output is a step function: 0 differences, or all of
   them. Diff at a FIXED input or do not diff. `verify` now teacher-forces.
2. **Report the MARGIN, not the mismatch.** "cpu 8790, gpu 2805" reads as a broken kernel; "margin
   0.075 against max|dlogit| 0.43" says the model was undecided and f32 broke the tie. One of those
   is a bug report and the other is a rounding fact, and the ids alone cannot tell them apart.
3. **A probe that passes while the pipeline fails is evidence about the PIPELINE, or about the
   harness -- and the harness is the cheaper hypothesis.** This is RULE 11 one layer up: there, the
   unmeasured thing was dispatch between the kernels; here it was the loop around the whole engine.
   Both times three careful analyses modelled the code and none checked the thing doing the asking.

Found by an outside review, which read `verify.go` and noticed the discarded warm-up in the first pass.
The value was not GPU expertise; it was that it had no stake in the theory being defended.

**★ 12j. METAL WAS NOT BANDWIDTH-BOUND, IT WAS INT-MULTIPLY-BOUND, AND ONE HELPER WAS 30% OF A
TOKEN.** The Metal tier sat at 0.60x of llama.cpp on both models -- and, more damningly, BELOW the
M4's own CPU tier (68.1 GPU against 70.9 CPU on tinyllama). `mvbench`, which prices each real decode
shape against a read wall measured in the same process, said where it went:

    gemma's shapes, GB/s and % of that device's own wall     CUDA/PTX        Metal/M4 BEFORE   AFTER
      q/o          2048 x  2048   Q4_0                     101   75%         43   46%       62   67%

**The Q8_0 row was already at the wall and every Q4_0 row was at half of it.** That single contrast is
the whole diagnosis and it took one run to see: identical kernel, identical access pattern, identical
device -- so the variable cannot be memory, and the two formats differ in exactly one way. Q4_0 packs
two quants per byte, so per BYTE READ it issues four times the `Dot4` a Q8_0 row does.

`ir.OpDot4` is one instruction on the other two targets (PTX `dp4a.s32.s32`, SPIR-V's dot). **Apple
silicon has no integer dot product**, so MSL lowered it as four sign-extends, four 32-bit integer
multiplies and four adds -- and Apple's ALU is fp32-centric, where a 32-bit integer multiply is a
multi-instruction sequence and a float FMA is one. Doing the same dot in float:

    float4 x = float4(as_type<char4>(a)), y = float4(as_type<char4>(b));
    return c + int(dot(x, y));

**This is not a precision compromise and it is not an approximation.** int8 x int8 is at most 16129
and the sum of four at most 64516; both are exactly representable in a float32 mantissa, so the
integer accumulation is bit-identical and the teacher-forced diff got BETTER, not worse (tinyllama
Metal went 1/32 positions to 0/32).

    tinyllama Metal   68.1 -> 87.49 tok/s   +28%    now 1.24x the M4's CPU tier, was 0.96x
    gemma     Metal   34.0 -> 44.69 tok/s   +31%
    vs llama.cpp Metal: 0.60x -> 0.77x (tinyllama) and 0.79x (gemma)

Three things worth keeping.

1. **"The same generated kernel is correct everywhere" is a property of the IR; "the same kernel is
   FAST everywhere" is not, and one op can carry the whole difference.** The IR's job is to name the
   operation the hardware wants; where a target lacks that operation, the lowering is not a detail.
   Audit the other MSL lowerings against their PTX counterparts for the same shape of gap.
2. **A per-format efficiency table is a faster diagnostic than a profile.** Two formats through one
   kernel on one device is a controlled experiment with the memory system held fixed, and it pointed
   at the arithmetic in one line. A profiler would have shown "the matvec is slow", which was known.
3. **The GPU tier being slower than the CPU tier on the same box was the loudest number on the
   scoreboard and it went unexamined for a while**, because the scoreboard compared each tier against
   llama.cpp and never against the row above it. Compare jitllm to jitllm first; it is the same code and
   the same model, so a loss there has nowhere to hide.

**★ 12k. AND THEN THE INT ACCUMULATOR TURNED OUT TO BE A COSTUME. +5.8% MORE.** 12j left Q4_0 at
67-74% of the Metal wall against Q8_0's 108%, with the remaining cost named: `ir.OpDot4` is typed I32,
so `jitllm_dot4` computed the dot in float and then converted BACK to int, and the int accumulator back
to float, on every four elements -- to honour a type that no consumer wanted.

**The matvec's accumulator chain has exactly one exit, and it is `CvtF32`.** `d_a * (scale*dot -
bias*sum)` needs a float; nothing else reads `iacc`. So the MSL lowerer now finds those chains and
carries them in float: a value qualifies when it is produced by `Dot4` or a `Phi` and every consumer
is another `Dot4`'s accumulator, a `CvtF32`, or a `Phi`. `CvtF32` on a carried value emits nothing at
all.

**It is exact, and that is checked per format rather than asserted.** A float32 mantissa holds every
integer below 2^24 = 16,777,216. The largest accumulation any shipped format reaches is a 256-element
Q6_K super-block at 256 x 127 x 127 = 4,129,024 -- a factor of four inside it -- and Q4_0's 32-element
sub-block is 60,960. The chain is not an approximation of the integer one, it IS the integer one,
which is why `TestMatVecMatchesReference` passes unchanged on every format, shape and split.

Two things worth keeping. **A peephole in ONE backend was right here, and the IR change was not.** The
tempting fix was an `OpDot4` whose accumulator type is the backend's choice, which would have put
Apple's ALU into the shared IR and made PTX and SPIR-V -- where `dp4a` and `OpSDot` genuinely are
integer instructions -- carry a concept they do not want. The IR says what the operation IS; a
lowerer is entitled to know that on this target the honest register is a float. And **the type in an
IR is a claim about the VALUE, not about the register**: nothing here changed what is computed, only
where it is held between two instructions that both wanted it elsewhere.

**★ 12l. METAL COMPILES WITH FAST-MATH ON, SO FLOAT ALGEBRA IS NOT A LEVER THERE.**
`newLibraryWithSource:options:` is called with nil options, which means
`MTLCompileOptions.fastMathEnabled = YES` -- the default. That PERMITS reassociation, so
rearranging float arithmetic in the MSL hands the compiler something it has already done.
Factoring the matvec's bias term (`scale*dot - (biasK*scale)*sum` into `scale*(dot - biasK*sum)`,
two instructions and two roundings fewer) measured EXACTLY ZERO, ABBA on the M4 at split=1:
q/o 48 47 48 48 against 47 48 48 48, gate/up 70 71 71 71 against 69 71 70 71.

That is the line between it and 12j/12k, which paid 28% and 5.8%: those changed WHICH
INSTRUCTIONS EXIST -- an integer multiply became a float one -- and no amount of reassociation
reaches that. **A Metal win has to come from the operation set or the access pattern.** The change
was kept anyway because PTX and SPIR-V do not reassociate by default, so there it is real.

★ **AND "SPIR-V DOES NOT REASSOCIATE BY DEFAULT" TURNED OUT WRONG WHEN IT WAS
MEASURED.** This box's NVIDIA Vulkan driver rewrites `(a+b)-b` to `a`, which
deleted a rotary kernel's whole range reduction and read |d| 2.0 against ptx's
5.96e-08 on the same IR. See the rotary-table entry at the end of this file for
the probe. What survives here is the sentence about METAL, which is unchanged,
and the narrower claim that PTX did not reassociate this expression.

**★ AND THE PER-ELEMENT INSTRUCTION TABLE SAYS WHERE Q4_0 ACTUALLY GOES.** Both formats' loops run
64 iterations issuing 8 `Dot4` each; they differ in how many bytes those 32 elements cost:

    per 32 elements    wt loads   act loads   unpack ALU   Dot4   bytes read   instr/byte
    Q8_0                   8          8            0         8        34          1.0
    Q4_0                   4          8           12         8        18          2.5

**Q4_0 needs 2.4x the instructions to consume a byte**, which is the whole of why it sits at ~80%
of the Metal wall while Q8_0 sits at 110% and is plainly memory-bound. Inside that budget the
dominant term is not the nibble unpack (12 ops) but the SIXTEEN byte-to-float converts, two per
`jitllm_dot4f` -- and eight of those are the ACTIVATION side, which all 2048 row-threads recompute
identically. Pre-converting activations to float in the quantize kernel would delete them at the
cost of 4x the activation load width; unmeasured, and the trade is not obvious.

**★ 12m. ASK FOR THE OPERATION BY ITS GRAPHICS NAME. THE METAL MATVEC WAS SPENDING MOST OF ITS
ARITHMETIC WIDENING BYTES.** `float4(as_type<char4>(w))` is a generic vector convert, which Apple
issues as four byte extracts and four int-to-float converts PER OPERAND. `unpack_snorm4x8_to_float`
is the same widening expressed as the thing GPUs have had dedicated hardware for since vertex
attributes existed, and it is one instruction.

**The per-ELEMENT rate is what found it, and the per-byte table had been hiding it.** 12j's table
reads Q4_0 at ~80% of the wall and Q8_0 at 110%, which looks like Q4_0 being the inefficient one.
Converted to elements per second it is the opposite:

    Q8_0 lm_head   99 GB/s / 34 bytes per 32 elem  =  93 Gelem/s
    Q4_0 gate/up   73 GB/s / 18 bytes per 32 elem  = 130 Gelem/s

Both issue 8 `Dot4` per 32 elements, so they have the SAME arithmetic per element and Q8_0 was
merely hitting memory first. That put the shared arithmetic ceiling at ~130 Gelem/s against Q4_0's
~178 memory ceiling, bounding the prize at 1.37x and saying it was arithmetic before anything was
built. Measured after, GB/s and fraction of the M4's wall:

    k/v (GQA)     34  37%  ->  49  55%        tinyllama Metal   96.0 -> 110.9 tok/s
    q/o           58  64%  ->  66  74%        gemma-2b  Metal   46.1 ->  53.6 tok/s
    gate+up       74  81%  ->  88  98%
    gate/up       73  81%  ->  98 108%        vs llama.cpp b10825, ABBA, gated:
    ffn_down      72  80%  ->  94 105%          tinyllama  0.824 -> 0.9955  IQR 0.017
    lm_head Q8_0  98 109%  ->  98 109%          gemma      0.830 -> 0.9406  IQR 0.011

**The unchanged Q8_0 row is the control**: it was memory-bound already, so it could not move, and the
fact that it did not is what says the Q4_0 rows crossed from arithmetic-bound to memory-bound rather
than the whole device getting faster.

**IT IS STILL BIT-EXACT, AND THAT WAS CONFIRMED ON THE DEVICE RATHER THAN ARGUED.** The intrinsic
yields v/127, so the dot arrives scaled by 1/127^2 with a rounding per lane; multiplying by 16129
and `rint`ing recovers the integer exactly, because the true value is an integer at most 64516 and
the accumulated relative error is ~1e-7 -- nowhere near the 0.5 that would round to the wrong one.
`rint` measured FREE against the un-rounded form, since by then the kernel waits on memory.
`TestMatVecMatchesReference` holds its 1e-10 gate on the msl backend across every format, shape and
split.

**THE FACT GOES IN THE IR; THE WIDENING DOES NOT.** snorm is `clamp(v/127, -1, 1)`, so it needs that
no operand byte is -128. That is a property of the DATA, so `ir.Dot4Bounded` asserts it and PTX and
SPIR-V ignore it -- `dp4a` and `OpSDot` take the full signed range at no charge. Putting Apple's
preferred widening in the shared IR would have been encoding one target's ALU there, which is 12k's
lesson. Q8_0 is the only format whose weights reach -128 and the only one that gains nothing, so it
keeps the generic path; every other format masks its quants to a small unsigned range (Q4_0 0..15,
Q3_K 0..7, Q5_K 0..31, Q6_K 0..63) and the activations are scaled by 127/amax.

**BOTH CONTROLS OF THE INVARIANT TEST WERE WRONG AT FIRST**, which is the part worth keeping. A table
filled with 0xFF is -1, not -128, so a deliberately mislabelled Q8_0 PASSED; and checking the packed
bytes of a 4-bit format reported Q4_0 as broken, because the kernel masks those nibbles before the
dot ever sees them. A test for an invariant has to be run against a violation before it is worth
anything.

**★ 12n. AND THE K-QUANTS ARE NOT THE NEXT PROBLEM ON METAL.** `mvbench` was gemma-only, so every
Metal conclusion had been drawn from Q4_0 and Q8_0 while tinyllama is 53% Q3_K. Measured in ONE run,
so the Q4_0 rows are the control for the thermal state: Q4_K 81%, Q3_K 88%, Q4_K 89%, Q5_K 82%,
Q6_K 84%, against Q4_0's 69-98% in the same run. Same band -- so after 12m there is no
format-specific deficit left, and tinyllama Metal's remaining 0.45% is not in the matvec.

**★ 12o. THE DEVICE READS 23% MORE BYTES THAN THE FILE, AND THAT DEBT IS WORTH PAYING -- MEASURED,
NOT ASSUMED.** `PackWeights` transposes for coalescing (free) and NORMALISES every k-quant payload to
a nibble or a byte (not free). `pack.go` has always listed the cost and called it known debt:

    format  GGUF B/256   device B/256   delta
    Q4_0        144          144          0%
    Q8_0        272          288         +6%
    Q4_K        144          192        +33%
    Q3_K        110          192        +75%
    Q5_K        176          320        +82%
    Q6_K        210          320        +52%

For tinyllama that is 0.60 GiB resident against ~0.49 GiB of weights -- **1.23x the bytes, read once
per token, on a tier whose binding constraint is bandwidth.** gemma is Q4_0+Q8_0 and barely pays it;
every k-quant model pays it in full, which is one reason tinyllama Metal sits at 79% of the wall
while its own kernels measure 81-89%.

**WHETHER SHRINKING IT PAYS DEPENDS ON A SLOPE, AND THE SLOPE COST ONE LINE TO MEASURE.** Q3_K's
values are 0..7, so `bits: 4 -> 8` in `qtab` is a correct alternative encoding that DOUBLES the bytes
and REMOVES the nibble unpack -- the same trade as native packing, run backwards. On the M4, same
shape (5632 x 2048), exact buffer sizes:

    bits=4   6.58 MB   146 B/256 elem    83.8 us
    bits=8  12.35 MB   274 B/256        140.3 us
    bytes x1.877  ->  time x1.674

**77% of a byte change becomes time.** My first reading of that was "so shrinking the payload pays,
roughly -15% on Q3_K" -- and that was WRONG, because it prices the byte side of native packing and
forgets the arithmetic side. **PRICED BOTH WAYS, THE DEBT DID NOT PAY.**

Two measured points fit `time = a*bytes + b*ops` (ops = loads + unpack, per 256 elements):

    bits=8   274 B    64 loads +   0 unpack   140.3 us
    bits=4   146 B    32 loads +  96 unpack    83.8 us   ->  a = 0.490, b = 0.0953

Native 3-bit is a 2-bit plane (1 word per 16) plus a 1-bit plane shared by two sub-blocks, which is
114 B -- but every 4 values then costs shift+mask for the low bits, shift+mask for the high bit and
an OR, so 24 loads and **320 unpack** ops:

    3-bit    114 B    24 loads + 320 unpack    88.6 us   predicted, 6% WORSE than bits=4

The same fit prices the other two: Q6_K native saves ~7% and is 10.6% of tinyllama's device bytes
(0.6% of the token), Q5_K saves ~18% and is 4% (0.6%). Q4_K gains nothing at all -- its nibble IS
native -- and it is 28% of the bytes.

**So the payload normalisation is roughly the RIGHT call on this hardware, and `pack.go`'s "known
debt" framing oversells it.** Sub-nibble packing cannot be extracted with the one-mask
`(w>>s) & 0x0F0F0F0F` shape every current format uses; it forces a plane split, and the split costs
more than the bytes save. The lesson is the pricing method, not the answer: **a byte-versus-op trade
needs BOTH coefficients, and one A/B in the cheap direction gives both.**

**★ 12p. AND THE LAST METAL LEVER IS THE ONE THE INTERFACE SAYS IS NOT NEEDED: 8% OF tinyllama's
TOKEN IS SPENT ENCODING LAUNCHES.** `backend.Recorder` is documented as CUDA-only because "Vulkan
re-records its command buffer every submission and Metal builds a fresh command buffer, so for them
a recording would be a copy of the work they already do". That is true and it is not the same as
free. A decode block issues ~30 dispatches and tinyllama runs 22 of them, so ~700 launches are
re-encoded EVERY token.

`Tier.TEmit` now times the encode separately from the wait, and `jitllm verify` prints it:

    tinyllama  Metal   0.86 ms/token encoding   8% of Layers
    gemma-2b   Metal   0.72 ms/token            3%

**That is the exact ceiling on a Metal recording** -- an indirect command buffer removes the
ENCODING and nothing else, so no argument about GPU-side dispatch cost is needed to bound it. 8% on
tinyllama takes 0.9955 to ~1.075, which is well clear of that comparison's 1.7% IQR; 3% on gemma
takes 0.9406 to ~0.97, which is not a win.

The reason it is bigger on tinyllama is arithmetic, not a defect: gemma reads 1.67 GB per token
against tinyllama's 0.64 GB, so the same fixed encode is a larger share of a shorter token. Any
model with many small layers pays it hardest.

**AND THEN TWO THIRDS OF IT WENT WITHOUT AN ICB AT ALL -- SEE 12q.** That matters for how the
number should have been read: 8% was the ceiling on removing the ENCODING, and an indirect command
buffer is only one way to remove encoding. The cheaper way was to stop doing so much of it per
dispatch. What is left of the idea is a 3% ceiling and a real hazard:
`MTLIndirectCommandBuffer`'s only compute command is `MTLIndirectCommandTypeConcurrentDispatch`,
while every kernel in a jitllm block consumes the previous one's output, so whether
`executeCommandsInBuffer` on a `MTLDispatchTypeSerial` encoder serialises them would have to be
established on the device first -- being wrong is a race that produces wrong tokens, not an error.
Not worth it now.

**★ 12q. THE FIRST MAC WIN CAME FROM THE HOST SIDE, AND EVERY KERNEL IS BYTE-FOR-BYTE UNCHANGED.**
The Metal encode path sent ~9 Objective-C messages per dispatch and looked up a selector before
EVERY ONE of them -- `sel()` allocates a NUL-terminated copy and calls `sel_registerName`, so each
dispatch cost ~16 FFI calls and ~8 Go allocations, ~700 times a token.

    the hot selectors are resolved once at load     -- they are process-wide constants
    setBuffers:offsets:withRange: binds all six     -- one message, not one per buffer

    encode per token   tinyllama  0.86 -> 0.34 ms       gemma  0.72 -> 0.29 ms

    vs llama.cpp b10825, M4, via scripts/vs-llamacpp.sh (n=320, ABBA, gated):
      tinyllama Metal  0.824 -> 1.021    ★ THE FIRST MAC WIN
      gemma-2b  Metal  0.830 -> 0.9440   IQR 0.006

    ★ QUOTE 1.021, NOT A SINGLE BEST RUN. Five gated passes read 1.0253, 1.0211,
    1.0238, 1.0121 and 1.0201 -- median 1.021, every one above parity, and the
    spread is real rather than thermal: llama.cpp holds 113.5-113.9 across all of
    them while jitllm swings 110.8-116.7. That is RULE 1d-quater's "jitllm degrades more
    under sustained load" showing up inside a single comparison, and it is why the
    IQR runs 0.008-0.031 between passes. The win is not in doubt; its MARGIN is
    about two points, not the two-and-a-half the best pass shows.

**★ AND THE FIRST NUMBERS I QUOTED FOR THIS WERE 1.0499 AND 1.0552, WHICH IS RULE 1d-quater CATCHING
ME.** Those came from an ad-hoc script at n=64, because that is what `llama-bench` defaults to and it
was the quick thing to write. Short samples flatter jitllm by about 2.5 points here -- llama-bench
discards a warm-up pass and `jitllm run` measures every token from process start -- so the comparable
figure is 1.024, not 1.05. Three passes at n=320 read 1.0253, 1.0211 and 1.0238; the win is real and
it is two points, not five.

**The lesson is to use `scripts/vs-llamacpp.sh` on BOTH hosts.** It already had a Darwin branch and I
wrote a second harness beside it, which is how the sample length silently diverged from the one every
Linux row in this file uses. A scoreboard whose rows come from two different tools is not a
scoreboard. (The clamp gate of RULE 2d correctly no-ops there: macOS has no /proc/cpuinfo, it prints
MHz 0 and discards nothing.)

**Three FFI calls per dispatch now against sixteen, and the measured encode fell only 2.5x rather
than 5x** -- the remaining 486 ns per dispatch is about the goffi floor, so further gains need FEWER
DISPATCHES, not cheaper ones.

Two things worth keeping. **RULE 12j's advice to audit the MSL lowerings was right and incomplete:
the tier is a Go program calling a C ABI, and that side had never been counted at all.** A profile
of the device would never have shown this. And **the arithmetic pointed straight at it**: ~700
launches x ~9 messages x ~135 ns is 0.85 ms, against a measured 0.86 -- when a modelled cost matches
a measurement to two digits, the model is naming the right thing.

**THE METAL TIER IS NOT RUN-TO-RUN DETERMINISTIC, WHICH IS WORTH KNOWING BEFORE READING A DIFF.**
tinyllama teacher-forces at 1-2/32 with margins of 0.010-0.061 against max|dlogit| 0.28-0.55, and
the COUNT AND THE MARGINS VARY BETWEEN RUNS OF ONE BINARY: the split tuner measures at runtime, so
the summation order of a matvec is not fixed. Do not read a changed tie count as a changed kernel;
run it three times first. gemma is 0/32.

**★ AND IT IS NOT METAL-ONLY. CUDA DOES THE SAME, WHICH THIS RULE'S WORDING HID.** Verifying an
unrelated tier fix, llama-2-7b on PTX read 0,1,1,1,1 across five runs of ONE binary and Phi-3.5 read
0,1,1,2,2, with margins of 0.002-0.06 against max|dlogit| 0.15-0.5. The mechanism is the same -- the
split tuner measures at runtime, so a matvec's summation order is not fixed -- and it has nothing to
do with Metal. tinyllama, gemma and qwen3-1.7B are 0/32 on every run and are the models to use as
controls; llama-2-7b and phi3 have argmax ties inside f32 noise and cannot serve as one.

**So a teacher-forced count is a GATE ON THE CLEAN MODELS and not a metric on the tie-prone ones.**

**★ 12u. THE PREFILL UNIT IS A CHUNK NOW, NOT A TOKEN, AND THAT IS RULE 12's OWN
FINDING ONE LEVEL UP.** RULE 12 moved the device's unit from one MATVEC to one
BLOCK. `engine/model/prefill.go` still fell back to per-token `Forward` whenever any
block was resident, so a 507-token prompt was 507 single-token submissions and
jitllm's device PREFILL rate was its device DECODE rate. `Layers(lo, hi, pos, n,
...)` takes n rows; every kernel in the block body grew a row dimension and every
matvec got a batched twin, built lazily on the first prompt that asks for one
because the scratch is ~85 MiB of score and probability buffers.

  - **THE MASK IS -inf, WHICH IS WHAT LETS THE OTHER TWO KERNELS STAY UNIFORM.**
    Query i of a chunk attends to i+1 more keys than query 0, and this IR has no
    conditional outside a loop -- so the scores kernel masks past each row's
    causal count and exp(-inf) is exactly zero. `pN` grows a header for it:
    element 0 is the uniform width, 1..rows are the per-row counts.
  - **THE DEVICE PICKS ITS OWN CHUNK WIDTH AND IT IS NOT THE TUNED ONE.** A
    batched submission runs ONE fixed grid, so a narrower chunk does not run less
    work, it runs the same work with the surplus rows zeroed: the tuner's 32
    measured 150 tok/s against 496 at 128. **A tuner tuned for the host's cost
    model is a cost the device does not have.**
  - **THE RAGGED TAIL'S SURPLUS ROWS WRITE K AND V TO A TRASH SLOT.** The first
    version gave the KV cache a whole chunk-width of slack instead, and that cost
    Phi-3.5 every one of its blocks on a 4 GB card. One extra position costs
    nothing and nothing ever reads it.

**★ 12u-bis. THE GATE IS BIT EQUALITY, AND THE FIRST TWO ATTEMPTS AT IT WERE
NUMBERS NOBODY COULD CALL RIGHT OR WRONG.** `jitllm verify -prefill` diffs batched
against per-token device prefill and then keeps decoding, teacher-forced from a
fixed stream, because a chunk returns ONE row of logits and writes n rows of KV.

    against the CPU tier      fired on BOTH arms: f32 against f64 on a random
                              token prompt sits on argmax ties, 1-3 of 17 either
                              way (RULE 12q). A comparison whose control fails
                              as often as its subject measures nothing.
    random ids                off-distribution, max|dlogit| up to 2.5. Real prose
                              from the model's own tokenizer sits on wide margins.
    unpinned splits           still ~0.5 apart, and it is not batching: a decode
                              matvec is split across segments and the weighted sum
                              across positions, and a batched launch does neither.
    splits pinned to 1        BIT-IDENTICAL. max|dlogit| exactly 0.

**So the gate is equality, and the control -- the same arm run twice -- is 0.000,
which is what makes 0.000 mean something.** tinyllama, gemma, qwen3, llama-3.2,
phi3 (partial seam) and qwen3moe all pass. Run against four violations per RULE
12m: no causal mask 15.7, RoPE-q at row 0's destination 18.6, padded rows writing
K/V at their nominal positions 6.0e9, and see 12v for the NaN one.

**★ 12v. Tok ALONE PLATEAUS, AND THE NUMBER THAT MATTERS IS LOADS PER FMA.** The
batched matvec gives one thread Tok token columns so a weight word is loaded once
and used Tok times. It stops improving at ~1.35 Tmac/s and does not care what Tok
is, because a thread owning ONE ROW reads Tok activation words for every weight
word: the load:dot4 ratio is 1:1 whatever Tok is. `mvbench -ntok 128` says it in
one line -- q/o reaches the memory wall at Tok=4 and then stops improving while
its weight traffic falls fourfold.

`Rowt` rows per thread share one set of activation loads. Gmac/s at the best Tok:

    Rowt=            1      2      4      8
      q/o          1345   2136   3194   2416
      qkv fused    1478   2443   4304   2856
      gate/up                    4015
      tll Q3_K                   3296

8 collapses -- 4x32 accumulators plus their integer partners do not fit. The rows
a thread owns are STRIDED by Rows/Rowt, not adjacent, because pack.go writes
element (word,row) at word*nrows+row and consecutive threads have to stay on
consecutive rows or the transposed layout stops coalescing. The tile offset is a
compile-time immediate on the load, so Rowt == 1 emits what it always did.

**★ AND 2.4-3x ON THE KERNEL WAS 1.22x ON THE MODEL, WHICH IS THE SEVENTH TIME IN
THIS FILE.** The difference is not thermal and not the thread count: the matvec
had stopped being the cost. `JITLLM_GPU_SKIP` omits a phase from the submission and
produces wrong tokens on purpose -- there is no per-kernel profile of a device
submission that does not serialise the stream, and serialising it would measure
the serialisation.

**★ 12v-bis. AND THE BATCHED ATTENTION WAS READING KV THE PROMPT HAD NOT WRITTEN.
THE PROBABILITIES BEING ZERO SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE OTHER OPERAND.** AttnAcc
walked the UNIFORM width for every row, on the reasoning that the masked
probabilities are exactly zero. They are. The V they multiply is not: for a
ragged last chunk it is memory nothing has written, and **0 * NaN is NaN**.

`LoopN` already takes a runtime trip count, so each row reads pN[1+row] and stops
at its own causal bound -- the correctness fix and the faster shape at once.
`JITLLM_GPU_POISON_KV=1` fills the cache with NaN at PrepLayer, which is the ONLY
way to test this:

    uniform width + poisoned KV   5/9 disagree, max|dlogit| 17.9
    uniform width + clean KV      0/9, max|dlogit| 0          <- why it hid
    per-row bound + poisoned KV   0/9, max|dlogit| 0

**A fresh device buffer is usually zero, so this class of bug is invisible until
it is not. Poison the buffer, do not trust the allocator.**

★ AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THE PER-ROW BOUND WAS AN ILLEGAL ACCESS ON ONE MODEL
ONLY. A padded row's nominal count runs past the END of the cache, so it faults
on the model with the widest kvDim and lands inside a neighbouring allocation on
every other one: Phi-3.5 (kvDim 3072) died with CUresult=700 where tinyllama
(kvDim 256) read someone else's buffer and PASSED ITS GATE.

★ NO GRAPH CAPTURE FOR A BATCHED CHUNK. The graph key carries the score width and
a chunk's width steps with its position, so every chunk got a fresh key: a
capture per chunk, used once, strictly worse than having graphs off.

**★ 12w. THE SCORES KERNEL WAS 88% OF BATCHED ATTENTION, AND IT IS THE SAME
DEFECT AS 12v IN ITS WORST FORM: TWO LOADS PER FMA.** An untiled thread loads 64
q floats and 64 k floats to produce 64 FMAs and ONE score. `AttnScoresTiled`
gives a thread qt query rows and kt key positions, so loads per score fall from
128 to 64*(qt+kt)/(qt*kt).

    qt x kt   1x1   2x2   2x4   4x4   4x2   8x4   4x8
    tok/s     697   913   829   933   982   860   813

**4x2, AND THE ASYMMETRY IS NOT NOISE.** The QUERY side is a broadcast -- every
key thread of a row reads the same q -- while the KEY side is a strided walk, so
widening q costs registers and widening k costs coalescing. **The key positions a
thread owns are STRIDED, not adjacent**, for the same reason Rowt's rows are: K
is [position][kv head][dim], so adjacent positions are kvDim*4 apart and adjacent
threads share a sector run.

★ AND THE SCORE ROW HAD TO BE PADDED, WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN A SILENT
WRONG ANSWER. ceil(cap/kt)*kt can exceed cap by up to kt-1, so the last tile
writes past the causal width -- and with an unpadded stride that lands in the
NEXT row's scores. Not a fault, a wrong number.

**★ WHERE THE PREFILL TIME ACTUALLY GOES, AT EACH STAGE. THIS TABLE IS WORTH MORE
THAN ANY OF THE FIXES, BECAUSE EACH TERM ONLY BECAME VISIBLE ONCE THE ONE BEFORE
IT WAS GONE.**

    phase                at 607 tok/s   at 1050
      scores                    326 ms     99 ms
      softmax                     3
      attnAcc                    38        49
      attention total           401       163      53% of the prompt -> 31%
      FFN projections           243      ~230
      everything else           132       132
      whole prompt              734       527

So the FFN projections are the largest single term again. **The durable finding
is not any one tile width: it is that on this device, a kernel issuing one
operand load per multiply is issue-bound before anything else is true. Count
loads per FMA first.**

**★ 12x. WHERE THE REMAINING 4x IS, MEASURED RATHER THAN GUESSED: llama.cpp RUNS
PREFILL ON INT8 TENSOR CORES AND jitllm RUNS IT ON dp4a.** `cuobjdump --dump-sass`
on this box's `libggml-cuda.so`:

    158,714  IMMA.8816.S8.S8      <- int8 tensor-core MMA
    167,712  HMMA.16816.F32
    463,877  LDS                  <- shared-memory staging
    217,968  LDSM.16.M88.4

jitllm emits `IDP4A` and no MMA at all: the IR has no matrix op. On GA10x the int8
tensor rate is about 4x the INT32 dp4a rate, which is the same factor as the
remaining gap -- but **that does NOT make MMA the required fix**, and the
arithmetic is worth doing before anyone starts one:

    dp4a peak on this card (64 INT32 lanes/SM)        7.68 Tmac/s
    jitllm's batched matvec, in model                    2.15   28% of it
    jitllm's batched matvec, isolated (mvbench)          3.30   43%
    what 5000 tok/s of prompt needs                   4.84   63%

**63% of dp4a peak is reachable without a tensor core**; jitllm is at 28% because
its reuse is entirely in registers and llama.cpp's is in shared memory as well.
So the next structural lever is a COOPERATIVE tile -- a CTA staging one operand
in shared memory so the reuse is 128 threads wide instead of Rowt*Tok -- and MMA
is the one after it, not instead of it. The IR has had `OpShared` and `OpBarrier`
since RULE 12s and the matvec does not use them.

**★ AND THE PHASE TABLE SAYS THE MATVEC IS ONLY 62% OF WHAT IS LEFT**, so even a
perfect one lands at 508/300 = 1.7x, or 0.41 of llama.cpp. Both halves are needed:

    FFN projections   226 ms   47%      q/k/v/o     74 ms   15%
    attention         166      34%      elementwise 54      11%

**★ THE K-QUANT FOLD IS NOT THE LIMITER, AND ONE CONTROL KILLED A DAY OF WORK.**
Counting the emitted IR for Q3_K says the per-sub-block float fold -- convert the
integer accumulator, multiply by the scale, fma with the activation scale, once
per (row, token, SUB-BLOCK) -- is about 45% as many operations as the dot
products it serves, and Q3_K's sub-blocks are 16 elements where Q4_0's are 32, so
it pays it TWICE as often. RULE 6b did exactly this fold in integer on the CPU
and was worth 3.7%. The obvious next move was to port it.

The control says no. gemma-2b is Q4_0 + Q8_0 and contains NO k-quants at all:

    tinyllama q3_K_M   0.2431   IQR/med 0.047
    gemma-2b           0.2678   IQR/med 0.032

**10% apart.** A model that cannot pay the k-quant fold is barely faster than one
that is 53% Q3_K, so whatever binds is common to both -- the GEMM's structure,
not its format. So porting the integer fold to the device was not expected to buy a row.

**★ AND SHARED-MEMORY STAGING OF THE ACTIVATIONS ALONE WILL NOT DO IT EITHER,
which is the review's point and it is right: it replaces a global load with a shared
load and adds a barrier. Both issue on the LSU.** What LDSM buys llama.cpp is
that ONE instruction fills a whole MMA fragment; without a matrix instruction to
feed, moving the operand to shared memory moves the cost, it does not remove it.

**★ 12ad. ONE MODEL THAT WAS CLEAN, CONFIDENT AND WRONG, recorded because the
reasoning looked airtight.** (This paragraph is what commit 5167a5f calls RULE
12ad; it had no heading of its own, so "RULES 12r-12ae" pointed at a rule that
could not be found. Numbered afterwards.) NormApply re-reads ALL the RMSNorm partials for EVERY element,
so its read count is rows*NEmbd*parts -- 131k at one row and 16.7 MILLION at 128
rows and 64 parts, 67 MB twice a layer, against a measured 39 ms for the whole
norm. Fewer parts therefore had to be faster. Swept:

    parts     1     2     4     8    16    64
    ms      567   529   516   532   519   494

The re-read is cached; the REDUCTION's thread count is not, and at parts=1
normPart runs 128 threads on a card with 30,000 slots. **A traffic argument that
ignores the cache is not a roofline.**

**★ 12ae. fp16 TENSOR CORES FOR THE ATTENTION SCORES, AND THE TRANSPOSED CACHE
MADE IT CHEAP BY ACCIDENT.** q.k is a matrix product and jitllm computed it with
plain FMA; llama.cpp emits 167,712 HMMA beside its 158,714 IMMA.

    SASS, tinyllama's shipping shape
      FMA tile (qt=4 kt=2)   1080 instrs   389 LDG   512 FFMA   4.2 instr/score
      m16n8k16 f16            264           53         4 HMMA   2.1 instr/score

    1920-token prompt, six pairs, every pair agreeing
      FMA 1.393 s -> tensor 1.336 (1.042x), and attnNT 2 over 1 a further 1.029x

**mma WANTS B COLUMN-MAJOR -- column = key position, row = head element -- AND
RULE 12aa HAD ALREADY STORED K THAT WAY FOR COALESCING.** The layout that made
the FMA kernel fast is the layout the matrix instruction wants. That is twice
now that a decision taken for one reason paid for the next one, and both times
because the JIT let the layout be chosen at load rather than baked into a
distributed kernel.

**★ AND IT IS THE FIRST ARITHMETIC IN THIS ENGINE THAT CANNOT BE BIT-IDENTICAL.**
binary16 operands into a float32 accumulator; there is no full-precision matrix
instruction on this hardware (tf32 is also 11 bits), so any tensor-core attention
makes the trade. **The gates moved with it rather than being relaxed:**

  - kernel level, NMSE < 1e-5 against the FMA kernel on five real shapes. The
    bar is derived, not fitted: binary16 gives ~5e-4 per product and ~2.5e-7
    NMSE on a 64-element dot, so 1e-5 is two orders of margin and still orders
    below a transposed fragment at 1e-1.
  - the MASK is checked SEPARATELY, because the NMSE loop cannot see it: it
    compares only positions INSIDE each row's causal count, so dropping the
    per-row mask changed nothing it looked at. Everything past a row's bound
    must be -inf, and that is now its own assertion.
  - end to end, **a flipped token id is judged BY ITS MARGIN**. A flip where the
    winning margin is narrower than the whole perturbation is the model being
    undecided; a flip on a WIDE margin is a defect rounding cannot explain.
    qwen3 flips one id of seven at 384 tokens on a 0.183 margin against a 1.67
    perturbation. Zero wide-margin flips on six models.

★ FOUR VIOLATIONS. The f16 A fragment read at the INT8 spacing fails the layout
probe at 64/128 elements -- a lane holds two halves per register, not four bytes,
so where s8 gives it four consecutive k, f16 gives two at 2t and two at 2t+8, and
reading the s8 table does not fault, it transposes a block. The A pair at stride
2 gives NMSE 0.997; dropping the causal mask trips the -inf check; the B pair at
stride 1 instead of kStride moves a logit by 29.8.

★ A REVIEW FOUND THE NaN AND THE GRAPH THRASH FROM THE SOURCE, and corrected the
roofline the whole thing was being judged against: GA10x has 64 INT32 lanes per
SM, not 128, so DP4A peak is ~7.68 Tmac/s and 4.3 is 57% of it rather than 28%.
It also caught `mvbench`'s k-quant bandwidth column being wrong by 8x --
`k/32*BlockBytes()` where BlockBytes is the SOURCE block, 256 elements for a
k-quant against 32 for Q4_0, so Q3_K read "2306 GB/s" against a 150 GB/s wall.
**A number that far above a wall measured in the same process is a units error,
not a cache effect**, and it had been on screen for an hour.

**★ 12y. INT8 TENSOR CORES. `ir.OpMMA` IS THE FIRST OP jitllm GENERATES THAT A LANE
CANNOT EXECUTE ALONE, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS IR.** dp4a, SDOT and OpSDotKHR are
per-lane and interchangeable; a matrix instruction is a CONTRACT BETWEEN LANES
about which element each one holds, and the kernel has to know that contract to
build a fragment at all. So the shape is IR and the encoding is the lowerer's.
`Op` grew a `Vargs` slice: MMA has up to ten operands and four results.

**★ AND jitllm NEEDS NO SHARED-MEMORY STAGING TO FEED IT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT
AND IS WHAT THE JIT BUYS.** llama.cpp stages weight tiles into shared memory and
reorders them with `ldmatrix` -- 463,877 LDS and 217,968 LDSM in its
disassembly -- because its kernels are compiled ahead of time against one fixed
weight layout. jitllm picks the packing at LOAD time for a kernel it has not
generated yet, so the packed layout can simply BE the fragment layout. It
already was:

    PackWeights writes qs[(si*words+w)*nrows + r], and for a 4-bit format word w
    holds elements {4w..4w+3} in the LOW nibbles and {sub/2+4w..} in the HIGH
    ones. mma's A fragment wants lane (g,t) to hold A[g][4t..4t+3] and
    A[g][16+4t..]. Those are the two nibble halves of ONE packed word at w=t,
    row=g. Two loads and four unpacks give a whole 16x32 fragment, and across
    the warp they are four runs of eight consecutive u32: 128 bytes in 4
    sectors, perfectly coalesced.

**THE K OF THE TILE IS THE FORMAT'S SUB-BLOCK, NOT A FREE PARAMETER.** Each MMA
produces one complete integer dot product and the per-sub-block scale multiplies
exactly that, so 16-element sub-blocks take m16n8k16 and 32-element ones
m16n8k32. Running k=32 across two sub-blocks with different scales assembles
cleanly and is wrong.

★ THE FRAGMENT LAYOUT IS GATED ON HARDWARE BEFORE ANY KERNEL DEPENDS ON IT.
`kernels.MMAProbe` is a bare int8 GEMM with A and B in NATURAL order in memory,
so the kernel does the gather and the test is not testing itself. It runs with a
RAMP as well as random data, because a transposed output is invisible on a
symmetric matrix. Run against a violation -- swapping the "+8 row" and "+16 k"
roles -- it fails at 64/128 elements.

★ AND THE MATVEC IS BIT-IDENTICAL TO THE dp4a ONE, which is the only sharp gate
available: both reduce each sub-block to an exact int32 dot (integer addition is
associative, so the tensor core's summation order cannot matter) and then apply
the same float fold. 36/36 subtests exact across all six formats, and
`jitllm verify -prefill` is 0/9 at max|dlogit| 0 on six models.

★ METAL AND VULKAN DECLINE BY NAME AND `lowertest` ASSERTS THE REFUSAL. MSL's
simdgroup_matrix is float only; Vulkan has OpCooperativeMatrixMulAddKHR but it is
an extension AND its fragment layout is deliberately opaque, so a kernel cannot
build a fragment with ordinary loads -- that needs a different kernel, not a
different lowering. Both reach tier as a Compile error and run the dp4a kernel.

**★ 12z. AND THEN THE SASS SAID THE KERNEL WAS 41% ADDRESS ARITHMETIC AND 2%
MATRIX INSTRUCTION.** cuobjdump on jitllm's own Q3_K prefill kernel:

    216 LEA   128 FFMA   97 IADD3   72 I2FP   72 FMUL   64 STG   44 LDG ...
    and SIXTEEN IMMA, out of 896 instructions.

**EVERY Load WIDENS ITS OWN 64-BIT ADDRESS.** `ir.Load` lowers to mad.wide.u32
plus ld, and a mad.wide is two SASS instructions; with eight different base
VALUES the kernel paid that eight times. But the rows a lane holds differ by
i*16 + h*8, the n-tiles by j*8*(K/4), the output columns by (j*8+c)*Rows -- every
one a COMPILE-TIME CONSTANT. So they are ONE base register and an immediate
displacement, which is the offset field Load already has.

    896 -> 592 instructions, 349 -> 99 address, same 16 IMMA
    554-token prompt: dp4a 495 ms, MMA before 430, MMA after 390

**Induction variables alone did NOT do it** (349 -> 276): ptxas reorders freely,
so emission order is a hint and the offset field is the lever. **The dp4a kernel
next to it has 20 LEA against 112 loads for exactly this reason.**

**★ AND THE INTEGER FOLD WAS BUILT, MEASURED AND REMOVED, WHICH IS THE MORE
USEFUL RESULT.** RULE 6b does it on the CPU for +3.7%. Built and gated here it
measured +1.7%; after the address fix the SAME change measured -25%:

                       before the address fix   after
      float fold             428 ms              390 ms
      integer fold           421                 489

The reason is REGISTERS: the integer partial is a second accumulator array, 64
int32 beside 64 float, and ptxas reports 173 registers against 127 -- 10 warps
to an SM instead of 16. Dynamically it issues ~25% FEWER fold instructions and
loses anyway. **On this kernel OCCUPANCY BEATS INSTRUCTION COUNT: price a change
in registers before pricing it in operations.** And RULE 5t for the second time:
an idea priced against an unoptimised baseline can flip sign once the baseline
improves -- this one flipped by 27 points.

**★ 12aa. THE DEVICE K CACHE IS TRANSPOSED, AND THE JIT IS WHY THAT IS CHEAP.**
Attention reads K with one thread per POSITION, so at [position][head][dim] the
32 lanes of a warp want addresses kvDim*4 apart -- 1024 bytes on tinyllama, 32
separate sectors to deliver 128 useful bytes. The SASS agreed: the scores kernel
was 1080 instructions of which 397 were loads.

    554-token prompt, three rounds, alternating
      [position][head][dim]   463  399  401 ms
      [head][dim][position]   369  318  330 ms      1.24x
      decode                   56   59   57  ->  55  57  60   unchanged

**IT IS ONE OFFSET EXPRESSION.** The rotation writes the cache and attention
reads it, and both are generated from the same session's decision --
`RoPERowsT` takes a destination stride and `AttnScoresT` the matching read
stride. llama.cpp cannot do this, which is why it stages tiles through shared
memory instead. **V is NOT transposed**, for the mirror reason: AttnAcc reads it
one thread per DIMENSION, already coalesced.

★ THE HOST'S CACHE STAYS ROW-MAJOR, so `MigrateKV` is where the two layouts meet
and it transposes on the way across. Copying straight would be a block attending
over a permutation of its own history -- the exact class of bug MigrateKV exists
to close (RULE 14m).

★ AND THE 2/24 THAT LOOKED LIKE A REGRESSION WAS THE SPLIT TUNER. Teacher-forced,
tinyllama read 0/24 before and 2/24 after -- and with the splits pinned both arms
read 1/24 at max|dlogit| 0.465, three runs each, identical. The transpose changes
an ADDRESS, not a summation order; the tuner's timing changed and it picked a
different split. RULE 12q as written.

**★ 12ab. A QUERY-ROW TILE ON AttnAcc, AND THE PADDED ROWS BROKE IT AT 8 AND NOT
AT 4.** V does not depend on the query row, so eight rows sharing a thread turn
eight V loads into one: 320 -> 303 ms, six pairs, every pair agreeing.

The tile walks the GROUP's widest causal count, so the softmax has to normalise
that far or the rows below read stale probabilities against real V -- which is
why `SoftmaxRows` takes the same tile and rounds its row index up to the group.

**And a padded row pinned at a count of ONE dragged that down**: a tile
straddling the padding boundary truncated every real row in it to a single key.
2-5 of 9 positions wrong on five models at max|dlogit| up to 59, at atile 8 and
not at 4, where the tiles happened to align with the prompt length. A padded row
now takes the LAST REAL ROW's count: in bounds, so the CUresult=700 that
motivated the clamp stays fixed, and never below its neighbours'.

**★ 12ac. AND A KERNEL SET PER CHUNK WIDTH, BECAUSE "EVERY KERNEL BAKES ITS
ELEMENT COUNT" IS NOT A REASON TO PAD -- jitllm GENERATES THEM.** A 42-row tail was
doing 128 rows of work for 42 rows of answer. 308 -> 300 ms, six pairs. Less than
the row count suggests because the tail sits at the HIGHEST position, so its
attention scales with pos+rows and shrinks 10% where its matvec halves.

The compiled kernels are the cache, not a pointer on the mv: a prompt asks for
two widths and one field could only remember one, which is what forced the
padding. Widths are multiples of 32, the matrix instruction's own grain. And it
is ELASTIC -- a scratch per width costs VRAM, so the narrow one is used only if
it allocates and the wide one pads otherwise.

**★ THE ROW, AND WHAT IS LEFT.** GPU prefill against llama.cpp, tinyllama:

    0.0307   per-token device prefill
    0.2431   batched chunk (12u)
    0.2885   int8 tensor cores + the address fix (12y, 12z)
    0.3410   transposed K cache (12aa)
    0.4059   AttnAcc query tile (12ab)
    0.4151   a kernel set per chunk width (12ac)   IQR/median 0.037, n=7
    0.4342   fp16 tensor cores for the scores (12ae)  -- SEE THE CAVEAT

★ QUOTE 0.4151 AS THE SOLID NUMBER. The 0.4342 pass had llama.cpp reading
4084-4232 where every other pass in this session put it at 4900-5360 -- a 17%
drop on ONE arm, which is the one thing ABBA cannot cancel and the IQR gate
cannot see (RULE 2d's mechanism, RULE 2c's warning). jitllm genuinely moved
1770 -> 1820 in the same pass, so the fp16 attention is worth about 3-4% and the
rest of that step is llama.cpp having a bad afternoon. Re-measure it rested.

Phase costs after all of it, marginal via JITLLM_GPU_SKIP: the matvecs are ~57% and
attention ~33%. The remaining structural levers are a CTA-cooperative weight
tile (reuse 128 threads wide instead of one warp's tile) and fp16 tensor cores
for attention, which llama.cpp also uses -- 167,712 HMMA beside its 158,714 IMMA.

## ★ RULE 12ah: THE SUBGROUP WIDTH IS A GUARANTEE NOW, NOT AN OBSERVATION -- AND THE PROBE THAT "SETTLED" IT PASSED WHILE THE KERNEL WAS BROKEN.

Measured on this laptop. Three Vulkan devices, one question: how many
lanes are in a subgroup?

    device                                   subgroupSize  min  max  size control
    NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti (discrete)                      32   32   32  yes, compute
    Intel Iris Xe ADL GT2 (integrated)                 32    8   32  yes, compute
    llvmpipe (software)                                 8    8    8  yes, compute

**THE FIELD EVERYONE REACHES FOR IS THE WRONG ONE.** The Iris Xe reports
`VkPhysicalDeviceSubgroupProperties.subgroupSize = 32` and runs a compute shader
at 16. That field is the DEFAULT width; the range is 8..32 and the driver picks
per shader. A capability check written against it passes on the one device that
is broken.

**AND THE ON-DEVICE PROBE PASSED TOO.** `tier.pickSoftmax` launched the warp
softmax against a host softmax at load and kept the scalar kernel on
disagreement. On the Iris Xe it agreed at n=1,2,31,32,33,37 on every head, and
the same kernel object then produced NaN logits inside a real submission of two
or more blocks, differently from run to run. An out-of-subgroup shuffle is
UNDEFINED, not wrong-by-construction: an idle device answers it correctly. The
probe is not broken -- on llvmpipe, which is narrow DETERMINISTICALLY, it
correctly rejected the warp kernel -- it is necessary and never was sufficient.

**A GATE THAT PASSES WHEN IDLE AND MISSES UNDER LOAD IS WORSE THAN A GATE THAT
NEVER FIRES**, which is the RULE 10 shape this adds to the list.

**THE CLASS, FOUND BY SWEEPING THE IR RATHER THAN THE KERNELS.** Two ops can make
a kernel's answer depend on which lanes share a subgroup -- `OpShuffleXor` and
`OpMMA` -- and `ir.WidthDependent` is now the one definition of that. Emitting
either sets `Kernel.Lanes`, `ir.Validate` refuses a kernel that carries one
without the declaration (and a declaration with no such op), and
`lowertest.TestEveryWidthDependentKernelDeclaresItsWidth` sweeps every shipped
kernel: 16 of 63 declare a width -- `softmax`, `headnorm`, two `mmaprobe` shapes
and twelve `matvec-mma`. `OpShared`/`OpBarrier` are workgroup-scoped and carry
their own synchronisation, so they are not in the class.

**WHAT REPLACED THE OBSERVATION.** `VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control`, bound through
purego with every offset pinned in `layout_test.go`: the width is PINNED at
pipeline creation with
`VkPipelineShaderStageRequiredSubgroupSizeCreateInfo` + `REQUIRE_FULL_SUBGROUPS`,
and a width the device will not promise is an ERROR out of `Compile` before a
pipeline exists. The promise is `min == max`, or a pinnable compute stage -- never
`subgroupSize`.

    pinned (shipping)        NVIDIA 32   Iris 32   llvmpipe scalar
    JITLLM_VK_SUBGROUP=off   NVIDIA 32   Iris SCALAR   llvmpipe scalar

The `off` row is the gate: without pinning the two real devices part company,
which is what says the rule is a rule rather than a constant.

**BEFORE AND AFTER, SAME BINARY.** `TestHeadNorm` on the Iris Xe
(`JITLLM_VK_DEVICE=1`), which had never had a probe in front of it:

    JITLLM_VK_SUBGROUP=force (the old engine)   16x128  0.25807052850723267 vs 0.20433825063960112
                                                1x2048  0.45949432253837585 vs 0.23119054648891962
                                                8x64   -0.3122132420539856  vs -0.22799779786197663
                                                1x32   -0.9338255524635315  vs -0.7725589102201517
    pinned                                      all four shapes PASS, both arms

1x32's -0.9338255524635315 is exactly a 16-lane reduction of a 32-element row, to
seven digits, deterministically -- the fingerprint of the bug.

**AND THE WORKAROUND IS DELETED.** `scripts/three-way.sh` set
`JITLLM_GPU_SOFTMAX=scalar` and now sets nothing: 22 blocks of tinyllama split 7
on the NVIDIA card, 6 on the Iris Xe and 9 on the host, token ids identical to
`-devices cpu` in both passes and both negative controls, with the warp softmax
and the 32-lane head norm running on the iGPU. `--violate subgroup-width`
(`JITLLM_VK_SUBGROUP=force`) puts the bug back and fails 3 or 4 assertions --
and WHICH ones is itself the evidence. Over four consecutive runs the
load-bearing `ids` assertion failed 4/4 (8 of 8 passes: the ids collapse to
`[... 338 0 0 0 ...]`, NaN logits argmaxing to token 0), while "the two passes
disagree" failed only 2/4, because the collapse moves between position 6 and 7
from run to run. Do not quote "4 assertions" as the expected result: the gate to
read is `ids`, which is deterministic, and `repeat` is the non-determinism
showing up when it happens to.

**THE SECOND KERNEL HAD NO FALLBACK AT ALL.** `kernels.HeadNorm` (qwen3/olmoe
q/k norm) takes `lanes` now, like the softmax, and `headNormScalar` is its
thread-per-head twin -- registered in `lowertest` so both are assembled by ptxas,
spirv-val and Metal's compiler. Neither existed before; the wide one reached
hardware through `tier` alone.

**NO CODEGEN MOVED -- AND THE RATE MOVED A LOT.** `TestDenseKernelsUnchanged`
reported exactly two new kernels and zero changed hashes, so every existing
kernel's PTX, MSL and SPIR-V bytes are byte-identical: the pinning is pipeline
metadata, not codegen. On a device that already promised 32 (every CUDA and
Metal device, and the NVIDIA card through Vulkan) the selection, the kernel and
the emitted code are all unchanged.

★ BUT "THE BYTES DID NOT CHANGE" IS NOT "THE SPEED DID NOT CHANGE", AND AN
EARLIER DRAFT OF THIS SECTION SAID "COST: NOTHING THAT MOVES" ON THE STRENGTH OF
THE HASHES ALONE. That is RULE 6-0-ter's checklist skipped: hashes answer
*correctness of emission*, not *time*. Measured ABBA in one pass,
n=20 rounds, six pinned P-cores, tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M, `-depth 738 -n 64`, ONE
binary so all three arms are reachable without a rebuild:

    Iris Xe decode      tok/s    ratio vs pinned   correct?
    warp, width ASSUMED  36.97   0.6864  IQR 0.012   NO -- NaN logits
    scalar twins         36.96   0.6811  IQR 0.017   yes
    warp, width PINNED   54.13   1.0000              yes

**THE UNPINNED WARP KERNEL RAN AT EXACTLY THE SCALAR KERNEL'S SPEED** -- 36.97
against 36.96 tok/s -- so before this work there was no configuration of this
iGPU that was both correct and fast. The workaround cost nothing *relative to the
bug*, because the bug was equally slow; pinning the width is what makes the
shuffle worth emitting at all, and it is worth **1.46x of an iGPU decode token at
depth 738** and 1.11x at depth 0 (0.9005/0.9071 scalar-vs-pinned, two passes).
Prefill moves far less, 0.9478 twice, because prefill is matvec-bound and the
softmax row is short per token.

The mechanism is the Intel compiler's SIMD mode, not the kernel: without
`REQUIRE_FULL_SUBGROUPS` and a required size the driver is free to compile the
shader narrow, and a 32-lane butterfly in a 16-lane subgroup is both wrong and no
faster than one thread per head. The pre-work binary (HEAD 7ee1edd, built and
ABBA'd against this one in the same pass) reproduces the assumed-width row
exactly: 0.6949 / 0.6856 decode over two passes, 0.9472 / 0.9478 prefill.

**THE iGPU ROWS, RE-TAKEN UN-HANDICAPPED.** The numbers previously on record for
this device were taken in another session and are NOT carried across (RULE 1);
both arms were re-measured here in the same pass, same binary, `scripts/cap 8G`,
`taskset -c 0,2,4,6,8,10`, tinyllama-1.1b-q3_K_M, PSI `some avg10` under 0.6
throughout. A/A self-control FIRST: **0.9941 (IQR 0.029) at depth 0, 0.9980 (IQR
0.022) decode and 0.9997 (IQR 0.002) prefill at depth 738.**

★ THE HOST ARM IS THE UNSTABLE ONE, AND IT IS STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN BAD LUCK.
Every iGPU-vs-iGPU comparison in this session gated tightly and repeated to
within 1% (IQR/median 0.001-0.064, both passes); every host-vs-device comparison
was 3-5x wider, one pass was rejected outright at 0.136, and the host prefill
arm moved 328 -> 365 tok/s between passes while the iGPU arm moved 248.8 ->
250.0. The two arms have different PACKAGE POWER profiles -- six P-cores flat out
against an iGPU sharing the same die and the same DDR5 controller -- so
alternating them is itself a thermal excitation, which is the one thing ABBA
cannot cancel (RULE 2c). **Quote host-vs-iGPU ratios to two significant figures
at best: 1.25-1.28 decode at depth 0, and do not read a 2% move as a change.**
The iGPU-vs-iGPU rows above carry the actual finding and they are the tight ones.

**AND THE iGPU STILL LOSES TO THE HOST, WHICH IS THE EXPECTED ANSWER.** Decode is
weight-traffic-bound and this device reads through the host's own DDR5 controller
out of the host's own weight budget, so it cannot win; the finding is that it
now loses by 1.25-1.28x instead of 1.39x, and that it is CORRECT while doing so.

**AND A NAME TABLE HAD FALLEN BEHIND AGAIN.** `ir.kindName` was missing `xor`,
so every kind after it printed as its NEIGHBOUR: the new width refusal reported
"op 5 (shared)" for a shuffle. A missing name in the MIDDLE is worse than a
missing one at the end, which is what the array's own comment had guarded
against. `TestKindNamesLineUp` checks the alignment now, not the length.

## ★ THE DECODE ROW TILE, RE-BUILT AS ADJACENT ROWS

**The earlier tile did not fail for being a bad idea; it failed for
having the wrong row mapping.** `tileOff(j)` returned `j*(Rows/Rowt)`, which
spread a thread's rows deliberately so adjacent LANES stayed on adjacent rows.
A lane then read ONE word of each of Rowt distant rows, and the tile bought
nothing but a shorter grid — which is why it needed `Split == 1` and why it
measured 49.41 / 36.96 / 21.05 / 9.36 tok/s at Rowt 1/2/4/8 on the M4 Metal
tier, time growing roughly in proportion to the tile.

**What the kernel was actually short of is BYTES PER LANE PER LOAD, and the
probe separates that from memory-level parallelism.** Same bytes, same grid,
a lane reading w consecutive words against w words one grid stride apart,
M4, 1 GiB working set (`kernels.StreamWide`/`StreamWideSpread`):

     4 B per lane                          64.6  65.2  65.9  66.1  66.4  68.0 GB/s
    32 B per lane, ADJACENT               106.3 106.5 106.7 106.8 106.8 107.0
    32 B per lane, one grid stride apart   65.8  66.9  68.4

The strided arm issues the SAME number of requests and is worth nothing. At a
256 MiB working set the same sweep moves only 91.8 → 96.9, which is why nobody
saw it: the effect is STREAMING-ONLY and every earlier look was inside cache.

**The container layout already supported the fix.** Weights are transposed at
upload to `qs[u*nrows + row]`, so the Rowt rows of an ADJACENT tile are Rowt
CONSECUTIVE u32 — the payload word, both scale planes, the bias and the output
all index through `tileOff`, so making it the identity and scaling the thread
index by Rowt is the whole change. **No IR op, no container version, no
repack.** That is the part worth keeping: the spread mapping was a kernel
choice, not a layout constraint, and the "MLX's literal qmv_fast shape needs
lanes along k" migration — a v16 bump and five readers — is not warranted.

**Split stops being an alternative and becomes a companion.** The tile buys
bytes per lane and divides the grid by Rowt; the split is exactly what puts
the grid back. `MatVec` refuses only `Experts > 1` with a tile now.

★ **NO RATE IS CLAIMED HERE.** The row belongs to a rested box with an A/A
self-control in front of it, and this entry is the correctness half.

★ **WHAT IT IS GATED BY, AND WHAT EACH VIOLATION READS.** Six violations, each
producing the stated failure; the two poison ones are the interesting half,
because a fresh device buffer is usually zero and an unwritten row then reads
as a plausible 0.0 (RULE 13's second invariant):

    base row not scaled by Rowt           row 515 NaN -- never written
    tile stride left spread               row 1 NaN
    output store left spread              row 1 NaN
    d plane read for tile row 0 only      NMSE 1.048e-02 (no hole: the bound's case)
    secondary plane not tiled             Q5_K 1.597 / 2.480, Q6_K 0.888 / 1.481,
                                          every SINGLE-plane format still exact
    tile refused beside a split           "reached NO matvec (112 plain)"

★ **AND ONE VIOLATION DOES NOT FIRE, WHICH IS RECORDED RATHER THAN HIDDEN.**
Removing `n /= m.rowt` from the launch — an oversized grid — PASSES, because
surplus threads are clamped to the last work item and recompute a tile that is
also computed correctly. RULE 13 licenses exactly that shape. It is wasteful,
not wrong, and no correctness gate can see it; only a rate can.

★ **THE TIER GATE PINS THE SPLIT TUNER, AND WITHOUT THAT IT IS NOT AN EQUALITY
GATE.** `tuneSplit` MEASURES at load, so the split — and the f32 reduction
order with it — varies per PROCESS; `three-way.sh` failed 1 run in 30 on
exactly that, at a 0.0017-logit margin. Pinned, the two arms take the same
fitted split and the only difference is which thread owns which row, so token
ids must agree EXACTLY rather than within a tie margin.

    Linux, CUDA + Vulkan, RTX 3050 Ti   16 blocks placed, 112 of 112 decode
                                        matvecs tiled, 112 of them split,
                                        16 ids identical
    M4, Metal                           the same three numbers, identically

★ **AND THE COUNTER HAD TO BE NEW.** `Stats.RowtTiles` cannot say the new
combination ran: a shape the tuner lands on `Split == 1` tiles without ever
reaching it. `Stats.RowtSplitTiles` counts tile-AND-split, and the gate also
asserts the CONTROL arm built zero tiles. This knob has that history — the
first version reached ZERO of 126 matvecs and read as a null result.

## ★ AND Q5_K ON THE MMA PATH THREW ITS FIFTH BIT AWAY — THE THIRD TIME A PLANE CHANGE MISSED mma.go

Found while running the gates above. Container v15 made Q5_K a 4+1
two-plane format at `sub == 32`. `mma.go` read a secondary plane in its
`sub == 16` arm ONLY — written when Q6_K was the only two-plane format — so
Q5_K fell into the first arm, which reads the nibble and never touches the hi
plane. CUDA prefill decoded five-bit weights as four-bit for every Q5_K
tensor; `matvec.go` beside it was correct the whole time.

`backend.TestMatVecMMAMatchesDot4` had been RED for it since v15:

    ptx/Q5_K/128x512/ntok8/4x1/win256
      out[tok 0][row 0]: mma 188.00941, dp4a -288.7448
      1024/1024 elements differ, worst |delta| 1563.26
      -- this path must be bit-identical

Twelve subtests, all Q5_K, all ptx; spirv takes the dp4a path in both arms and
so passed, which is the same one-backend blindness the v15 row-pairing had in
the other direction (CUDA `+Inf`, Vulkan exact).

**mma.go's own header already records the previous two occurrences**, and that
is why the fix is not another `case`: the lane's element GROUP is derived from
the format's arithmetic now — group `gi` sits in secondary word `gi/lanes` at
bit `hi*(gi%lanes)`, which is `matvec.go`'s `hiOf` verbatim — and a shape whose
word index is not constant over the lane is REFUSED by name rather than
approximated. An unreachable-looking format that is silently wrong is what the
previous two were.

★ **AND THE GOLDEN COULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT IT: `kernels.sha` HOLDS 55 HASHES AND
NONE OF THEM IS AN MMA KERNEL.** The bit-equality gate against dp4a is the
stronger check and it was already there — it was simply red and unread, which
is RULE 11b's point about a gate that is always red.

★ **THE TWO STALE `matvec/Q5_K` GOLDENS WERE BLESSED, WITH THE BEHAVIOUR
RE-DERIVED FROM SOMETHING THAT IS NOT THE GOLDEN.** They had been red since
v15 for the same packing change, correctly. The non-golden evidence is
`backend.TestMatVecRealWeights`, which runs a REAL Q5_K tensor against
`quant.Dequant` on every backend and FIRES against a Q5_K-specific violation.
Exactly two of 55 lines move; the other 53 being untouched is the second
statement, and it is also what proves the adjacent-row tile emits NOTHING new
at `Rowt == 1`.

★ **AND `TestMatVecRealWeights` GAINED THE TILE DIMENSION, WHICH IS WHERE THE
TWO-PLANE FORMATS LIVE.** Q5_K and Q6_K load `hiw[j]` through the same
`tileOff` and had no tiled coverage anywhere: the synthetic case builds only
Q4_0, Q8_0 and Q4_K blocks by hand. Six formats x two splits x three tile
widths, ptx, spirv and msl.

★ **AND THE BATCHED PREFILL KERNEL SHIPS A TILE THAT NO KERNEL GATE ASKED
FOR.** `batchMV` picks `Rowt` from `batchRowt`, which is FOUR, so every prefill
matvec the tier launches combines NTok, Tok and Rowt — and `ntokCase` built its
kernel at `Rowt == 1`. The shipping shape had only end-to-end coverage. It was
already true before this work and matters more now, because one `tileOff`
serves decode and prefill.

## ★ PER-DISPATCH GPU TIMING IS NOT REACHABLE ON THE M4, AND FOUR ROUTES WERE MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.

The Metal accounting closes at 93.7% -- streaming 7.493 ms, dispatch overhead
0.450, head excess 0.429, **0.558 unattributed**, no single term over 5%. The
obvious next instrument is to time each of the ~445 dispatches in a token
individually. It cannot be built on this hardware:

| route | result |
|---|---|
| `supportsCounterSampling:atDispatchBoundary` | **FALSE** |
| `supportsCounterSampling:atStageBoundary` | TRUE, and it buys nothing |
| Instruments **Metal System Trace** | records; the per-shader tables are EMPTY |
| Instruments **Metal GPU Counters** | *"Selected counter profile is not supported on target device"* |

★ **THE FIRST ONE IS THE WHOLE ANSWER AND IT COST TWENTY MINUTES INSTEAD OF TWO
HUNDRED LINES.** A sample buffer cannot fire between launches on this device, so
per-dispatch timing would need ONE ENCODER PER LAUNCH -- and a compute encoder
is `MTLDispatchTypeSerial`, so the instrument would serialise the token it is
measuring and add an encoder's cost to each of ~700 dispatches. That is this
file's own recurring failure: the read-wall probe measured itself, and its
"fix" was committed before it was measured and made the number worse.

★ **AND STAGE-BOUNDARY SAMPLING IS NOT A CONSOLATION PRIZE, WHICH MATTERS
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE ONE.** `Batch` opens exactly one encoder per command
buffer (`metal_darwin.go:603`), so an encoder-boundary timestamp returns the
interval `GPUStartTime`/`GPUEndTime` already returns. It is the SAME NUMBER
through more code, not coarser resolution.

★ **THE INSTRUMENTS TRACE DID RECORD, WHICH IS WHY ITS EMPTINESS IS EVIDENCE.**
`metal-shader-profiler-intervals` and `gpu-shader-profiler-interval` exist in
the schema and hold **zero rows**: the Shader Profiler is not among the
instruments `xctrace` exposes (GPU, Metal Application, Metal GPU Counters, Metal
Performance Overview, Metal Resource Events -- it is an Xcode-GUI-only
facility). What the trace carries instead is 855 command-buffer submissions, 854
encoders and 868 completions -- command-buffer granularity, again -- plus 1071
`metal-driver-event-intervals`, which turn out to be memory WIRING events
(`Wire 16.45 MiB System Memory`) and not dispatches at all.

★ **WHAT REMAINS IS THE METHOD THAT PRODUCED THE ACCOUNT IN THE FIRST PLACE.**
Repeat an idempotent op N times and regress the slope: that is where the 1.09 us
dispatch cost and the 2.106-2.116 ms head figure came from, it needs no FFI, and
it is not blocked by any of the four rows above. Its limit is that the op must be
idempotent -- attention writes the KV cache, so it cannot be repeated in place --
so it can price the norms, the quantize and the matvecs and not the whole layer.

`Ctx.CounterSampling` and `Ctx.CounterSets` are kept as a PROBE rather than an
assertion: both answers are legitimate hardware and a newer GPU may say
otherwise. `metal_other.go` carries the stubs, because `metal.GPUBusy` being
darwin-only in the header broke the Linux build of `./engine/model` once already.

## ★★★ THE DEVICE HAD NO SLIDING WINDOW, AND THE FIRST PROBE SAID IT DID.

`nn.LayerPlan` carried the local/global PERIOD so the tier could pick gemma3's
local rotary table, and nothing else: every local layer on a device attended its
whole causal history. gemma-3-1b on CUDA at 712 positions (window 512):

    device-vs-host                      8.5e-02
    device-vs-host-with-window-removed  9.7e-05

Fixed by baking the window into the three scores kernels (decode, FMA tile, MMA)
as a mask to -inf on keys before `cnt - min(cnt, W)`. Exact: the softmax gives
those keys zero weight and the accumulator adds 0*V over keys the prompt DID
write. Softmax and accumulate are untouched; window 0 emits identical IR.
`backend.TestAttnScoresWindowMasksExactlyTheOldKeys` holds it bit-for-bit on
ptx and spirv; `model.TestSlidingWindowRunsOnTheDevice` holds the model.

**Three traps on the way, each of which produced a confident wrong reading:**

- **The first probe measured the host.** Device-vs-host read 1.5e-04 past the
  window with 0 of 26 blocks still placed: two States shared one tier, the first
  had prepared the blocks for 498 positions, and `layersOnce` refused position
  498 with no error (`pos+nrow > p.MaxSeq`), so the State restarted every later
  token on the host. The gate now fails if a placed block leaves the device.
  (That silent refusal of a larger second State is itself worth fixing.)
- **Two unpinned tiers disagree with each other** by up to 5e-03 at early
  positions -- `tuneSplit` picks a reduction order per process. Read against the
  host, that looked like an all-local window bug. Pin with
  `tier.WithDeviceTune(tier.TuneOff)`.
- **A narrowed window on a model not trained with it is chaos.** Phi-3.5 at 16
  keys on every layer: host 0.26 from transformers (loading the same GGUF),
  device 0.48, the two 0.02 apart -- every engine amplifying its own rounding.
  gemma-3-1b at a 64-key window spikes to 0.28 at one token class on BOTH tiers
  against transformers while sitting at 1e-4 elsewhere. Gate where a correct
  device is close: gemma's own window, or every layer local at 128.

## MXFP4 and float weights run on the device, and the tier never told it a block had sinks.

**MXFP4.** The IR has no byte shuffle, so the e2m1 table is computed rather than
looked up. `kernels.decodeE2M1` maps four codes, one per byte lane, to the
biased table values: with `q = s|e1|e0|m` and `l = q&3`, the doubled magnitude
is `l + (l if b2) + 4*b2 + 2*(b0 b1 b2)` and the code is `(v+12) - (2v if s)`.
Every byte stays in 0..24, so nothing carries across lanes, and after it the
format is Q4_0's shape with bias 12: the dp4a kernel and the tensor-core
kernel both call it at the nibble unpack. `backend.TestMatVecMatchesReference`
(exact e2m1 values) and `TestMatVecMMAMatchesDot4` hold it on PTX, SPIR-V and
MSL. Dropping the `2*(b0 b1 b2)` term reads 1.7e-02; skipping the decode in
mma.go alone fails the MMA gate. The llama.cpp `prmt` and MLX f16 bit-trick
routes surveyed beforehand were not needed.

**Float weights (F32, F16, BF16).** They declined every block ("attn_q is F32,
which has no device kernel"), so synth-gptoss, a tied F32 head, and an HF
conversion's matrices stayed on the host. `kernels.Float32/Float16/BFloat16`
are device formats whose pack is a copy of the rows; `kernels.MatVec` reads
them row-major against the FLOAT activation, passed in the scale-plane slot, so
the launch shape does not change. The tier records the activation's float
source structurally: a launch writing `(bs.a, bs.ax)` quantizes its first
buffer (`la`, `dOf` in `layersOnce`).

The first version read the int8 activation instead, and every kernel gate
passed, because the reference used the same quantized activation. Four hybrid
gates went red: the fixture's tied F32 head moved to the device and lost the
precision the host keeps (pre-shrink logit NMSE 2-5e-4, a second session
drifting to 1.6e-1). With float activations the llava tower, whose mmproj is
F16, matches the host at 5.9e-9 after one block.

**The offered plan.** `offerRange` built `plan := s.plan` while `planFor(li)`,
the only thing that sets `AttnSinks` and `MoEBias`, served declines alone. So
the device built a gpt-oss block's scratch without sinks or mixture biases,
skipped their uploads and ran without them: NMSE 1.7 from position 0 on CUDA
and Vulkan alike, with every sink and bias kernel green in isolation -- RULE
11c's shape exactly. `TestSynthGPTOSSOnEveryDevice` now runs every block and
the head on each backend against the host, routing pinned (a random 4-expert
router near-ties, and the flip is not a defect), with the down and up biases
scaled so a logit can see them. Worst 1.5e-3 on CUDA/Vulkan and 4e-12 on Metal;
the plan reverted, the sinks or the router bias dropped, or any expert bias
misread, lands at 0.08-2.0.

## ★★★ THE ROTARY TABLE IS A DEVICE KERNEL, AND THE MAGIC-NUMBER ROUNDING IT WAS TRANSCRIBED FROM DOES NOT SURVIVE A SPIR-V DRIVER.

`kernels.RoPE`'s own comment said the table was uploaded because *"sin/cos on a
GPU is an approximation whose error is vendor-specific, so computing it here
would make q and k differ between CUDA, Vulkan and Metal for no gain"*. That
objection is against calling a DRIVER's transcendental and it still stands. It
was doing duty for a different sentence -- that the device had no rotary table
at all -- which is RULE 8a's own failure mode: a graph change on the CPU alone
removes the capability from the device, not as an error but as an absence.

`kernels.RopeTable` is the fourth transcription of the host kernel that landed
alongside it (jit/cpu/ropetab.go and its SSE and NEON twins are the other
three): the same four-digit position decomposition, the same folded planes, the
same degree 7/8 minimax pair on |r| <= pi/4. It calls nothing of the vendor's.
The planes are DATA -- `nn.Rope.TabPlanes`, folded in float64 once per model at
load -- so `jit/gpu/kernels` borrows nothing from `jit/cpu` but the layout,
which moved down into `kernels/ropetab_const.go` because `jit/cpu` already
imports that package and the other direction is a cycle.

**Measured against the host kernel's own table, on real hardware, all three
backends:**

| backend | device | worst vs host table | worst vs a float64 oracle |
|---|---|---|---|
| ptx | RTX 3050 Ti | **5.960e-08** | 5.960e-08 |
| spirv | RTX 3050 Ti (Vulkan) | **5.960e-08** | 5.960e-08 |
| msl | M4 | **5.960e-08** | 5.960e-08 |

5.960e-08 is ONE ULP at 1.0, and it is the same figure engine/nn/ropetable.go records
for the host kernel against the float64 table it replaced. Eight geometries from
four rotary pairs (stories260K's head dimension is eight) to 128, one to 32
rows, mscale on and off, and eighteen positions from 0 to 2^28-1.
`model.TestRopeTableOnDeviceMatchesTheUpload` runs both arms in ONE process on
Llama-3.2-1B and gemma-3-1b with every block placed and the split tuner pinned:
24 tokens identical and **worst |dlogit| exactly 0.000e+00**, so the ulp above
is the kernels' worst case over the whole swept position range rather than the
token's.

★ **AND THE GATE ASKS FOR A BAND RATHER THAN THAT ZERO, WHICH IS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CONTRACT AND AN OBSERVATION.** The two tables are two
SPELLINGS of one reduction -- integers and half-up here, two magic adds and
half-even there, unfused Fma on one backend -- so an ulp between them is
permitted by the design and the kernel gate measures exactly that. A gate
demanding zero would one day fail for a reason nobody can act on. It demands
1e-3, which is far under anything a real defect produces (a wrong rotary base
moves a gemma3 logit by 0.1, a wrong quadrant by whole units) and far over an
ulp, and it LOGS the zero rather than requiring it. Run on CUDA here and, through
a cross-compiled test binary, on the M4's Metal -- 30 and 60 rows built against 0
uploaded, bit-identical on both, plus a 362-token prefill at 363 built and 0
uploaded. RULE 11d is why the Mac run is not optional: the M4 is where two of
the HOST kernel's four violations turned out to be doing nothing at all.

**★ AND 12l's PARENTHETICAL IS REFUTED: SPIR-V DOES REASSOCIATE, AND IT DELETED
THE WHOLE RANGE REDUCTION.** That entry ends *"the change was kept anyway
because PTX and SPIR-V do not reassociate by default, so there it is real."*
The first version of this kernel transcribed the host's mod-four fold verbatim
-- `x - ((x+M)-M)` with M = 2^25, three instructions, exact on every CPU here --
and read **|d| ~ 2.0** on spirv against 5.96e-08 on ptx, which is a whole
quadrant and not a rounding. A four-line probe of the two steps alone:

    (x+M)-M          returns x UNCHANGED for every x        -> the round is gone
    x - ((x+M)-M)    returns ZERO for every x               -> the fold is gone

The driver rewrites `(a+b)-b` to `a`, which is not an IEEE-valid transformation,
and loading M from a BUFFER does not stop it -- it is algebra on unknown values,
not constant folding. **A magic-number rounding is not portable to this IR.**

**★ THE REMEDY IS INTEGERS, AND IT IS STRICTLY BETTER THAN THE THING IT
REPLACES.** s is a sum of exact multiples of 2^-12 under 2032 (the host file's
bit count), so `s*2^12` is an integer under 2^24 that converts exactly, masking
with `4*2^12-1` IS the remainder mod four, and scaling back is a power of two.
Nothing there is float algebra, so there is nothing to reassociate -- on any
driver, including Metal's, whose fast-math default 12l already records and which
this kernel therefore never had to find out about. The remainder lands in [0,4)
where the host's lands in [-2,2]; n absorbs the multiple of four, f = rem-n is
the same exact float, and bits 0 and 1 of n -- the swap and the two signs -- are
what a multiple of four leaves alone. It also removes a subtlety the host
carries: the device's n is never negative, so nothing rests on two's complement.

The rounding itself is the other half. The IR's only float-to-integer op is
`ir.OpCvtI32`, which truncates toward zero, and the integer fold is what makes
adding a half sound rather than a second magic: rem+c is never below -1/16, so
truncation IS the floor. Round-half-up and round-half-even differ only at an
exact tie, and a tie is genuinely a tie here -- at f = +1/2 and f = -1/2 the
quadrant swap and the sign flip turn the same two polynomials into the same two
answers, because the sine fit is exactly odd in r and the cosine fit exactly
even.

**★ AND THE CONSTANT BLOCK IS READ AS u32 AND BITCAST, WHICH IS NOT STYLE.**
Two of its words are integers stored through `math.Float32frombits`, and the
integer one is `0x00000001` -- the smallest DENORMAL as a float32. A GPU is
entitled to flush denormals, and a flushed one turns "cosine's quadrant is n+1"
into "cosine's quadrant is n": every value finite, every shape right, a
quarter-turn wrong in two quadrants of four. Declaring `pConst` as a u32 buffer
never lets a float unit near them. Unmeasured as a failure, because it was
designed out before it could happen -- recorded as a hazard that was reasoned
about rather than a bug that was found.

**★ THE VIOLATIONS GO IN THROUGH THE UPLOADED BLOCK, WHICH IS THE HOST's IDEA AT
THE DEVICE's SEAM.** Five, each removing exactly one step, and every one fires
on ptx, spirv and msl:

    quadrant-selection    cosine's quadrant taken from n, not n+1   |d| 1.410e+00
    sign-step             bit 1 stops deciding the sign             |d| 2.000e+00
    no-mod-4-mask         the digit products are never folded       |d| 2.000e+00
    no-round-to-integer   n truncated rather than rounded           |d| 9.018e-05
    swapped-sin-cos       made in the COMPARISON, as nn's is        |d| 1.412e+00

The last two are the device's own and have no host twin, because no host tier
reads those words -- they stand in for one instruction each that the IR does not
have. `RopeTabMagicWord` is absent from that list for the same reason: the
device does not read it, so zeroing it would be a violation that removes
nothing, which is exactly the green line RULE 10 refuses.

**★ THE ROW COUNT IS RUNTIME WHERE EVERY OTHER SHAPE IS BAKED, AND A CHAT PROMPT
IS WHY.** A prefill's last chunk is narrower than the batch width and the host's
staging fills the rest of the table with ZEROS -- which no position produces,
since position zero gives cosine one. The first version uploaded that case
rather than argue the trash rows cannot matter, and the counters said what that
cost: on a 362-token prefill **257 rows built and 128 uploaded**, and on a
chat-length prompt 25 built against 32 uploaded, because a prompt shorter than
the batch width is ALL ragged. Clamping the kernel to a valid count read from the
buffer, and zeroing the table once at scratch time, takes both to **zero
uploads** with the logits still bit-identical. One load, and the difference
between this kernel serving every prefill and serving none of the short ones.

**★ AND IT IS A KNOB, NOT A DECLINE, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE ON THIS SEAM THAT IS
TRUE.** `Layers` is handed the finished cs/csSWA tables as well as the planes,
so a device that cannot compile the kernel uploads the table exactly as it did
before and computes the same logits -- unlike sinks, post-norms or a window,
where the absence is fluent and wrong. What must not happen is the absence being
SILENT, so `Stats.RopeTableWhy` carries the reason, `RopeTables`/
`RopeTableUploads` say which arm ran, `jitllm run` prints both, and
`jitllm verify -ab ropetab` refuses rather than comparing a knob that reached
nothing.

## A one-launch RMSNorm (one 128-thread workgroup per row) is a REGRESSION on a V100

Motivation: nvprof on a Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB (the V100 host, CUDA) put jitllm's
Llama-3.1-8B decode at ~821 launches a token against llama.cpp's ~614, with the
norm as three of them per FFN (Add 2.3 us + NormPartRows 4.9 us +
NormApplyRows 3.4 us) where llama.cpp's rms_norm_f32 is one kernel of 5.8 us.

Built `kernels.RMSNormRows` (workgroup per row, squares summed in shared
memory, optional residual add folded in), gated bit-for-bit-ish against a
float64 RMSNorm on CUDA and Vulkan including ragged widths, and wired it into
the tier's norm closure and the add->FFN-norm pair. Measured, one V100, n=128,
ABBA, 3 rounds:

    Llama-3.1-8B   103.6-109.2 -> 98.4-101.4 tok/s   (about -6%)
    olmoe-1b-7b    272-290     -> 256-277            (flat to worse)

Reverted. The cause is occupancy, not the launch count it was meant to cut:
a decode norm is ONE row, so one 128-thread group runs the whole 4096-wide
reduction and apply on one SM, where the partitioned pair spreads it over 64
partials and 32 groups. llama.cpp's version uses 1024 threads a row; getting
there needs a tree reduction the IR cannot express without conditional
execution (RULE 13), or a shuffle-based one gated on a 32-lane subgroup. The
workgroup-per-row norm was tried without either, and lost.

## Flushing L2 before each split-tuner trial was tried, and it is a REGRESSION on a V100

The hypothesis: `timeSplitMode` launches one kernel four times back to back on
the same weights, and a 1024x4096 Q4_K matrix (2.4 MB) sits in a V100's 6 MB L2,
so the tuner picks splits for a cache-resident weight while decode reads every
weight from DRAM. The per-token trace looked like support: k/v matvecs at 12 us
for 2.4 MB (~200 GB/s), q/o at 572 GB/s, against gate/up at 768 and the head
at 842.

Built: a 16 MiB `kernels.Restride` streamed through the cache before every
timed launch (a constant cost, so the argmax needs no subtraction). The choices
moved to larger splits (k/v 8g -> 32g, gate/up 4g -> 8g, down 16 -> 32), and
decode got slower. The V100 host, V100-SXM2-16GB, CUDA, Llama-3.1-8B Q4_K_M,
n=128, one process per sample, ABBA, 6 each:

    no flush   115.47 110.53 115.78 116.12 115.72 111.36   median ~115.6
    flush      114.09 109.13 110.57 109.17 109.94 112.53   median ~110.3

So a flush-separated trial is the wrong imitation of decode. What decode does is
stream a DIFFERENT block's weights of the same shape on every launch, and timing
exactly that sequence is right: `devTier.retuneDecode` (same day) re-picks each
shape over the placed blocks once they are all on the card, and measured +2.4%.
The per-shape optimum was read off nvprof kernel medians in the graph first
(1024-row Q4_K: 12.0 us at the in-cache pick of split 8, 8.2 at 32 in-group).

## Latent attention (MLA) prefill is batched on the device, and the DeepSeek-V2 family takes the grouped mixture path

DeepSeek-V2-Lite ran 0 grouped mixture blocks after the grouped MoE prefill
landed, because `layersOnce` refused ANY latent block at rows > 1 ("multi-head
latent attention has no batched submission yet") -- the whole chunk, dense lead
and mixtures included, went one row at a time. Two more gaps sat behind it:
`prepBatch` precompiled only q/k/v/o/gate/up/down, so the shared expert's
matvecs, MLA's kv_a/q_a/q_b and a linear block's projections would have been
compiled lazily inside the session; and the grouped mixture refused V3 grouped
routes (`ExpertGroups > 1`) and the kernels refused `Rows` with groups.

`tier/mlabatch.go` is emitMLA over R rows with no new kernel: Rows twins of the
slices, norms, copies and rotations; both absorbs as GROUPED matvecs with the
head as the expert (activations gathered head-major, every head's run exactly R
columns); AttnAccTiled at the latent width over the row-wide cache.
ExpertGroupScore/ExpertGroupMask and ExpertRank's grouped plane take a row
stride (rows == 1 emits the same IR; lowertest unchanged).

Gates: `backend.TestRouteRowsMatchOneRow` (bit-exact against per-row launches,
five route shapes; fails at row 1 with the group-score row stride dropped).
`model.TestBatchedMixturePrefillMatchesRowByRow` on a V100 (CUDA, sm_70),
300-token prompt, 12 generated: V2-Lite 78 grouped / 81 batched latent blocks,
NMSE 9.97e-4, ids identical; Coder-V2-Lite 7.07e-4; Moonlight 4.35e-4. Against
a violation (the absorb activations gathered token-major): NMSE 5.80e-1, ids
part at token 7.

V100-SXM2-16GB, CUDA, `jitllm speed -devices cuda:0 -r 2` (p512, n128), ABAB,
same pass as llama-bench b60eeeb6 `-p 512 -n 128 -ngl 99 -r 3`:

## A mixture's prompt on sm_70's tensor cores -- the grouped GemmVolta, and MLA's attention on m8n8k4

nvprof on a V100 before this work: the grouped mixture ran every expert matvec
of a batched chunk on the dp4a grouped kernel (223 ms of gpt-oss-20b's ~297 ms
pp512; 119 ms of DeepSeek-V2-Lite's 357 ms), and V2-Lite's latent attention
scores ran on the FMA tile over the row-major latent cache (attnscorestiledw,
5.87 ms a layer, 158 ms of what was left). llama.cpp's sm_70 build does not use
mmq for a prompt-sized mul_mat_id (mmq.cu ggml_cuda_should_use_mmq: fp16 MMA
hardware and a batch over the dp4a bound); ggml-cuda.cu ggml_cuda_mul_mat_id
sorts the tokens by expert on the host and runs a dequantize + cuBLAS f16 GEMM
per expert.

What was built, each gated and measured in its own commit:

                               tensor cores behind a green gate. Stats
                               GroupedVolta / MLAScores70 / MLAAcc70 are the
                               selection checks; on sm_70 the scratch has no

Kernel probe (backend.TestGemmVoltaGroupedSpeed, random routing of a 512-token

A 64-column block wins where an expert averages >= 48 tokens (voltaUnit).

End to end, Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB, CUDA, `jitllm speed -p 512 -n 128 -r 3`,
main 9c8fe57 against 49561a6 with llama.cpp sm_70 `llama-bench -p 512 -n 128
-ngl 99 -r 3` between them, one ABBA pass:

What is left on gpt-oss-20b's prompt after all of it (nvprof, tuner off): the
grouped GEMM is still about half the kernel time at ~17-19 TMAC/s against the
dense GemmVolta's 34-37 -- its token blocks are 32-64 columns where the dense
one's are 128, and 25-35% of the columns are padding. A wider block over the
experts that have the tokens, or a k-split for the thin ones, is the next lever
and is unbuilt.

## The M4's Metal rows -- a simdgroup_matrix prompt GEMM, IEEE libraries, a width check, and a Wait that polls

The goal was every losing M4 row against llama.cpp b10985 on the same GGUF.
The commits carry the full numbers; this is the map and the null results.

**Prefill was the dp4a tile on a GPU with no integer dot.** Llama-3.2-1B's
512-token prompt read 77.7 tok/s batched against 104 token by token and 1604
for llama.cpp. `kernels.GemmTile` (eeab55b) is llama.cpp's
`kernel_mul_mm` (ggml-metal/kernels/mul_mm.metal) in the IR: voltaDeq staging
into threadgroup memory, ActF16T activations, four simdgroups of 8x8 half
tiles into float accumulators, double-buffered. It needed `ir.TilePhi`, tile
load/store through a shared array and `SubgroupIndex`; PTX and SPIR-V refuse
the new forms by name and the tier asks for the tile on msl only. 0.048 ->
0.880 of llama.cpp on Llama (18.2x). The grouped form (00cbb41) takes a
mixture's experts through the sm_70 grouped contract unchanged: Qwen3-MoE
0.40 -> 0.81.

★ **TRIED, AND NULL:** a
single-buffered GemmTile, a 16-half row pad, and a k-split all measured no
gain; the big shapes already run 3.1-3.3 TFLOP/s against the M4 GPU's ~3.76
fp32 peak. What is left in prefill is the THIN shapes (1.0-1.4 TFLOP/s: a
1536- or 256-row projection does not fill the GPU) and attention, which still
runs the FMA tile on Metal.

**Metal was the only fast-math backend.** `newLibraryWithSource:options:nil`
compiles with fast math, where PTX emits `.rn` and SPIR-V carries no
fast-math flags; three backend gates were red on msl alone for it
(RMSNormQuant 1408 of 4096 words, the fused delta rule 7.6e-05, the expert
route by one ulp). Strict compile options (75208e0) fix all three and cost
0.1-0.5% (fast/strict pp 1.002-1.005, tg 1.001-1.002 on three models).
llama.cpp keeps fast math; this engine does not follow it there (RULE 7m).

**A launch at the wrong width is a wrong answer on Metal only** (97e3b00): msl
lowers `OpNTID` to the declared workgroup as a constant. `mtlKern.checkWidth`
refuses it, and on its first run it found the tier launching
`headNormScalar` (declared 64) 32 wide whenever a head is narrower than a
subgroup -- heads 64c+32..63 of every group were never written. The launch
geometry follows the lanes each norm was built at now (headNormGeom).

**The decode round trip.** GPU clock and host timestamps split the M4's
0.52 ms idle gap between two decode tokens into 0.18 ms of host and
0.32-0.34 ms of commit-to-start plus wake-up latency. Polling the command
buffer's `status` before `waitUntilCompleted` (08a2fe7, 20 ms budget) removes
the wake-up: tg +4.7% Llama, +4.4% Qwen2, +2.5% gemma. llama.cpp
(ggml-metal-context.m) blocks too and hides the latency by encoding the next
of n_cb command buffers; a decode token here is one buffer.

**The M4 board after all of it** is in docs/perf/current.md.

## The V100 decode rows below parity are not host time, measured four ways

Phi-4-mini, gemma-3-12b, Qwen3-1.7B Q8_0 and gemma-2-9b sat at 0.957 / 0.977 /
0.988 / 0.993 of llama.cpp (tg128, V100-SXM2, sm_70, same pass). What was priced:

    CUDA calls inline on the caller's thread   +0.3..+1.1%, SHIPPED (125b3c5)
    a decode token as TWO recordings (2 blocks  null: 189.0 vs 188.8, 73.7 vs
      then the rest), so the card starts while  73.5, 91.7 vs 91.7 tok/s
      cuGraphLaunch is still returning
    graphs off (direct launches)                -1.5% (185.6 vs 188.5)
    per-kernel time, nvprof                     parity: matvecs 3.77 vs 3.81 ms,
                                                the rest 1.64 vs 1.58 a token
    device timeline, nvprof --print-gpu-trace   5.83 vs 5.91 ms a token, kernels
                                                5.44 vs 5.43, idle 0.39 vs 0.48

`jitllm run` now prints "host per submission" (tier.Stats TSubStage /
TSubLaunch / TSubRead / TCapture): Phi-4-mini reads stage 59 us, launch 232 us
(26 of it three captures a 256-token run), read 4954 us. The launch looked like
the idle the gap is made of; splitting it proved the card was not waiting on it.

★ **SO UNDER A PROFILER THE TWO ENGINES ARE THE SAME AND WITHOUT ONE llama.cpp
IS ~4% FASTER ON THESE ROWS**, both at the same 1530 MHz SM clock, and
llama.cpp drawing 222 W against jitllm's 150 W (jitllm's average includes its
load, so that is a lead, not a measurement). What differs unprofiled is
unattributed. llama.cpp runs these without CUDA graphs on pre-Ampere cards.

## Metal prompt attention as one simdgroup_matrix kernel

The M4's Metal prefill gap GREW with the prompt, which is attention's signature
(the matmuls already ran as GemmTile at 3.1-3.3 TFLOP/s): Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M
0.93 / 0.88 / 0.77 of llama.cpp b10985 at pp128 / 512 / 2048, SmolLM2-360M
0.86 / 0.76 / 0.60. Attention on msl was the scalar FMA tile plus a score matrix
written and re-read between three kernels.

`kernels.FlashPrefillTile` is FlashPrefill70's algorithm on the ir tile ops:
K and V staged as binary16, S = Q K^T per simdgroup into workgroup memory, four
lanes a row for the running max / sum / binary16 P and the rescale of an O that
lives in workgroup memory (a simdgroup_matrix has no lane layout, so none of
that can happen in registers), then O += P V. llama.cpp's kernel_flash_attn_ext
keeps O in the same place. `backend.TestFlashPrefillTileMatchesReference`:
NMSE 1.3-1.7e-7 against float64 with every slot past the count poisoned; the
dropped-key violation reads 1.5e-3. `model.TestFlashPrefillMatchesThreeKernels`
on Metal: Llama 4.2e-4 and Qwen3-0.6B 3.4e-4 against the host, the same as
the three kernels.

M4 Metal prefill, tok/s, llama.cpp b10985 in the same pass:

| model | pp512 was / now / llama.cpp | pp2048 was / now / llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|
| Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M | 1407 / **1532** / 1604 (0.955) | 1160 / **1446** / 1505 (0.961) |
| SmolLM2-360M Q8_0 | 3297 / **3973** / 4351 (0.913) | 2208 / **3475** / 3676 (0.945) |
| Qwen2-1.5B Q4_K_M | 1052 / **1106** / 1159 (0.954) | 887 / **1005** / 1098 (0.916) |
| gemma-2b | 758 / (746) / 848 | 692 / (629) / 809 |

gemma-2b (head width 256, one kv head) is NOT taken: its blocking is 16 query
rows (8 at first, 421 tok/s at pp2048), so K and V are re-staged per 16 rows,
and it measured below the three kernels. The fix is one staging of K/V for
all the heads that share it, which the float32 O in workgroup memory leaves no
room for at width 256 -- a two-pass form (max and sum first, then P V with O in
registers) is the candidate.

### V100 decode: the per-token hand-off, measured on the device clock

`JITLLM_CUDA_TIMING=1` (`backend.SetCUDATiming`) brackets every replayed graph
with two CUDA events on the capture stream and reads them one replay later, so
`jitllm speed` prints the graph's device time and the device idle BEFORE it --
the hand-off: sync, argmax readback, the host's token work, x's upload and the
next launch. Gated by `backend.TestCUDAGraphTimingReportsEveryReplay`
(an after-event recorded before the launch reads 4 us and fails).

Phi-4-mini Q4_K_M, V100 GPU 0, tg256, two runs, medians per token:

    graph on the device   5,156 / 5,216 us
    idle between graphs     116 /   118 us   <- the hand-off, 2.2%
    wall                  5,304 / 5,367 us   (the events cost ~1%)
    llama.cpp, same box   ~5,060 us for its WHOLE token (197.6 tok/s)

★ AND llama.cpp's HAND-OFF IS BIGGER, MEASURED THE SAME WAY. An LD_PRELOAD
shim around llama.cpp's own `cudaGraphLaunch` puts the identical event pair on
its stream (it costs llama-bench nothing: 196.8 against 197.4 tok/s). It DOES
replay one CUDA graph a token on this sm_70 build (128 graph traces for 128
tokens under nsys), which retires the "it launches kernel by kernel below
Ampere" guess. Phi-4-mini, tg256, two runs, medians per token:

    llama.cpp   graph 4,853 / 4,860 us   gap before 201 / 200 us
    jitllm      graph 5,159 / 5,158 us   gap before 117 / 116 us

**The whole 0.95 is the graph: +300 us, 6.2%.** jitllm's hand-off is already
85 us SMALLER than llama.cpp's, so removing it outright would read ~0.97 and
cannot close the row -- which is the measured reason the goal's first lever is
not the one. No profiler resolves the in-graph term: nvprof reads the two
engines' kernels at parity (both slowed to ~168 tok/s), nsys at graph level
puts jitllm AHEAD (177.7 against 175.8 -- tracing costs llama.cpp 11% and
jitllm 6%), and ncu's isolated kernels inflate jitllm's Q4_K matvecs 2.7x
against llama.cpp's 1.04x, which describes kernels run alone with
millisecond gaps between them, not the decode. `-ab graph` puts the replay
2.5% ahead of launch-by-launch, and both engines run at the 1530 MHz max
clock. What separates the in-graph 300 us is a per-kernel device-clock split
taken the same way on both engines (event nodes between the captured
launches), which has not been built.

### V100 decode: the in-graph 300 us is attention, and a KV-head flash-decode kernel

`JITLLM_CUDA_KERNEL_TIMING=1` (jitllm) and `scripts/kshim.c` (llama.cpp, an
LD_PRELOAD shim) take the SAME measurement: during capture an event NODE is
recorded after every launch (`cuEventRecordWithFlags(..., EXTERNAL)` -- a plain
record inside a capture is only a dependency edge, and cuEventElapsedTime
refuses it), so each replay stamps every kernel's end on the device clock.
Event nodes cost ~3.9 us each on both engines (jitllm 5,158 -> 7,455 us over
583 nodes, llama.cpp 4,856 -> 6,936 over 550), subtracted below. Phi-4-mini,
V100, tg256, per token:

| | jitllm | llama.cpp | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q4_K matvecs | 2,053 us | 1,876 | +177 |
| Q5_K qkv | 547 | 522 | +25 |
| Q6_K head + down | 1,139 | 1,191 | -52 |
| norm + quantize | 530 | 555 | -25 |
| **attention** (4 kernels / flash vec + combine) | **564** | **278** | **+286** |
| rope + KV copies | 312 | 273 | +39 |
| SiLU (jitllm fuses it) | -- | 87 | -87 |

`kernels.FlashDecodeKV` (tier.Config.FlashKV, `JITLLM_GPU_FLASH=2`, with
`JITLLM_GPU_FLASH_GROUP` / `_SPLIT`) is the shape `65317aa` named: a
128-thread workgroup per (query-head group, key partition), threads over keys
for the scores against one K load, block reductions, warps over keys and lanes
over dimensions for V, and FlashAttentionMerge's partial layout.
`backend.TestFlashDecodeKV` holds it to FlashAttention's oracle on 652 shapes
(CUDA and Vulkan); normalising every head by head 0's sum fails 66 of them.

★ IT IS NOT YET THE LEVER ON THE V100, MEASURED. `TestFlashAttentionAB` at
Phi-4-mini's shape (24/8/128), V100, against the staged sequence:

    272 keys    best 0.997x (group 1, 4 partitions)
    2048 keys   1.264x (group 1, 16 partitions)
    in the model, tg256   graph 5,299-5,327 us against the staged 5,155-5,164

(On the laptop's RTX 3050 Ti it is 1.27x at 128 keys.) The first two forms
were 0.30-0.62x: ncu read 32.7 cycles per issued instruction at 7.5% achieved
occupancy -- a dot emitted load, FMA, load, FMA waits out every load's latency
when a workgroup has four warps, where the staged kernels hide it under
thousands of threads. Issuing K blocks ahead of their FMAs over four chains
took it to parity at short context. What is left is the scores phase's
per-key cost on few warps (1,035 instructions a warp at 17 cycles each); the
layout that removes it is llama.cpp's -- warps over keys, lanes over
dimensions, the query in registers -- and it is unbuilt. Default stays the
staged path. (Superseded the next day: the next entry rebuilds the scores and
makes the kernel CUDA's default.)

### V100 decode attention as one kernel per split, CUDA's default

**What the opt-in kernel was doing in the model.** `JITLLM_CUDA_KERNEL_TIMING=1`,
Phi-4-mini, tg256 at 16+256 positions: `flashkv` 1,706 us a token against the
staged four kernels' 1,069 (both include ~3.9 us of event node per launch). The
tier had given it ONE partition (MaxSeq fit one chunk) and a whole GQA group a
workgroup -- 8 workgroups of 128 threads on 80 SMs, 53 us a layer.

**The rebuild.** Scores: lanes over KEYS (a 32-key tile, coalesced because K is
`[dimension][position]` on the device), warps over SLICES of the dimensions
(Wd slices of at most 32) times Wk groups of tiles, the query slice in
registers; a lane issues its slice's K loads at once and a key's dot is Wd short
chains folded through shared memory. llama.cpp's fattn-vec puts lanes over
dimensions, which on this cache layout would be 32 uncoalesced loads a key; the
transpose of its idea is what fits the transposed K. Values keep the previous
form (warps over keys, lanes over dimensions, row-major V).

Three knobs, each set by measurement on the V100:

- **Splits per depth.** A graph is recorded per nCap (128-key steps), so the
  tier compiles a variant per split and picks by nCap (`blockScratch.flashFor`).
  Kernel-level, Phi-4-mini's shape (24/8/128), best split against staged:
  128 keys 4 (1.59x), 512 8 (1.70x), 2048 16 (1.51x), 8192 16 (1.81x; 32 read
  1.61x). The rule is the power of two nearest sqrt(n/8), capped at ~1.6
  workgroups an SM (`Slots()/1280`), floored by what the chunk needs for
  correctness. With the tier's choice every shape tried wins at every depth:
  24/8/128 1.51-1.71x, 32/16/128 1.20-1.77x, 16/8/256 1.08-1.66x, 64/8/64
  1.43-1.71x (128 to 8192 keys).
- **Width.** One warp a 32-dimension slice: Phi-4-mini (head 128) 199.6 tok/s
  at 4 warps against 198.2 at 8; gemma-3-12b (head 256) 77.0 at 8 against
  74.1 at 4, where a lane holds 64 query values a head. `ptxas -v` on the
  generated PTX read 568 bytes of spill at head 256 with 4 warps.
- **Query heads a workgroup, capped by registers.** Uncapped, a whole GQA group
  shares a K load: gpt-oss-20b (8 heads, 32 values each) decoded at **165.9
  against the staged 189.0** and Qwen2.5-1.5B (6 heads) at 327.7 against 336.5.
  Capping the group at 96 query registers a lane turned both into wins (192.0
  and 361.5). Phi-4-mini's 3 heads (96 values, 238 registers, no spill) is the
  largest that measured a win.

**In the model** (tg128, V100 GPU 0, same pass, staged -> new):

    Phi-4-mini     190   -> 199      gemma-3-1b    302 -> 328
    gemma-3-12b     73.6 ->  77.0    Qwen2.5-1.5B  342 -> 361.5
    gemma-2-9b      92.2 ->  97.0    Llama-3.2-1B  501 -> 526
    Qwen3-1.7B Q8  247.7 -> 264      gpt-oss-20b   189.3 -> 192
    Qwen3-8B       121.7 -> 123      gemma-3-27b (2 GPUs) 37.95 -> 38.77

Against llama.cpp in that pass: Phi-4-mini 1.01, gemma-3-12b 1.02, gemma-2-9b
1.05, gemma-3-27b 1.00, Qwen3-1.7B Q8_0 1.06.

**Gates.** `backend.TestFlashDecodeKV` holds the kernel to FlashAttention's
oracle on 2,892 shapes (head widths 7/48/64/96/128/256, 2/4/8 warps, groups,
splits, windows, sinks, softcap, f16 V), on the laptop's 3050 Ti and the V100;
dropping one dimension slice from the fold fails 522 of the then 652.
`tier.TestFlashAttentionModel` now runs the KV kernel on a placed model (per-depth
split and split 3) against the staged path on CUDA and Vulkan; launching half
the workgroups fails it at logit NMSE 0.11-2.7 with a greedy flip. Its
fused-vs-staged NMSE takes one of two values (2.4e-13 or 1.9e-4 on stories15M),
swapping between CUDA and Vulkan as the width changes -- one int8 activation
rounding flip, which that test's own comment already describes.

**Defaults.** CUDA and Metal take the KV kernel unless `JITLLM_GPU_FLASH=0`
(`tier.Config.NoFlashKV`); Vulkan was not measured and keeps the staged path.
Metal, M4, same pass against llama.cpp b10985: tg128 Llama-3.2-1B 113.4 ->
114.7 (0.983 of llama.cpp's 116.7), Qwen2-1.5B 89.9 -> 90.6 (0.988 of 91.5).
Gated there by TestFlashDecodeKV and TestFlashAttentionModel. Kernel level,
TestFlashAttentionAB on msl at the tier's splits:

    shape (heads/kv/dim)    128 keys   512 keys   2048 keys
    32/8/64  Llama-3.2-1B   0.80x      1.00x      1.31x
    12/2/128 Qwen2-1.5B     1.34x      1.37x      1.64-1.67x

So head width 64 LOSES at short depth on Metal while the model still gains
1.1% in tg128 -- the kernel is chosen per device, and the next step is to
choose it per depth too, by measurement. (A first take of this table read
1.34-1.38x everywhere: the arm64 runner forwarded a test's environment only
through a variable of its own, so that run timed FlashAttention's warp-per-head kernel at the
bench's default shape. The commit message of 656cd7c quotes it.) `JITLLM_GPU_FLASH_SPLIT`, `_GROUP` and `_WARPS` force the three
knobs.

**What this does not touch.** The other half of Phi-4-mini's in-graph term,
the Q4_K matvecs (+177 us), and on gemma-3-12b the norm/rope/quantize chain:
kshim against event nodes there puts the matvecs level (10,279 against 10,282
us a token, event overhead subtracted) and jitllm's elementwise chain ~250 us
above llama.cpp's.

### Figures moved out of jit/gpu/tier comments

These figures stood in source comments under `jit/gpu/tier/` until a comment
cleanup trimmed them, and were recorded nowhere else. They are kept here
verbatim, grouped by the symbol each one justified. Unnamed "this card" in the
original comments is the laptop's RTX 3050 Ti; V100 is the 8x V100 server's
V100-SXM2-16GB; M4 is the Mac.

**`BatchTok = 16` (layer.go).** A chunk of NTok tokens with Tok columns a
thread reads the weights NTok/Tok times. tinyllama reads 0.49 GB of weights a
token and this card streams ~153 GB/s, so the ceiling is 312*Tok tok/s; 16
puts it at ~5000, where llama.cpp's prefill sat. The best Tok moved from 8 to
16 when the scores kernel got its tile (12w), with attention going from 53% to
31% of the prompt:

    Rowt=4    Tok=4   Tok=8   Tok=16      Rowt=2 Tok=16   929
    tok/s       836    1035     1096      Rowt=8 Tok=8    731

**`mmaMT, mmaNT = 4, 4` and `batchMV` (layer.go).** Swept end to end on
tinyllama's 554-token prompt: 4x4 1287 tok/s, 2x4 1029, 4x2 955, 2x8 894, 4x8
725. Wider tiles run out of registers (a lane holds MT*NT*4 accumulators);
narrower ones read the weights more times a chunk, since a pass covers 8*NT
tokens. MatVecMMA measured 1.4-3.2x the dp4a kernel on this card and
bit-identical to it. 16*4 divided every row count of every model then on the
box (2048, 256, 5632, 32000, 16384, 256128, 1024, 6144, 512, 8192, 3072, 9216,
4096, 11008, 12288), so a six-rung tile ladder never once fell back.

**`volta70AccMT = 1` (AttnAccMMA70's dims per warp in 32s).** It was the whole
head (up to four), which on Qwen3-1.7B at 512 tokens (16 heads of 128) launched
256 warps on 80 SMs. nvprof on a V100, same trace, as a fraction of the
6144x2048 GemmVolta beside it (the clock moved between runs): mt=4 0.667, mt=2
0.377, mt=1 0.337.

**sm_70 attention MMA (`initScratch`, m8n8k4).** On a V100 the FMA tiles ran
Llama-3.1-8B's 512-token attention in ~29 ms of a 180 ms prompt (scores 14.6,
accumulate 12.1) against llama.cpp's 5.4 ms flash kernel.

**`kernels.ExpertRouteWarp` (initScratch).** ExpertRoute's thread per expert
walks every logit: 31.4 us at qwen3next's 512 experts on a V100.

**Decode on `deltaScan` where the device has a subgroup (initScratch).**
GatedDeltaStep was 47.5 us a call on a V100 against llama.cpp's
gated_delta_net_cuda at 5.6 -- 36 calls, 1.7 ms of Qwen3-Next-80B's decode
token (nvprof). The fused kernel is decode-only: in the chunk as well,
Qwen3-Next-80B's pp512 fell 1515 -> 1063 tok/s on four V100s.

**`blockScratch.qkPart/qkApply` (wide q/k norm, olmoe).** HeadNorm there is one
32-lane group for 2048 elements, 22.8 us a call on a V100, against ~7 us for the
block norm's partitioned pair at the same width.

**`pickSoftmax`.** A load-time timing probe was built and removed: on an M4,
swapping the selection moved a 64-token decode from 97.62 to 97.64 tok/s.

**`pickLanes`.** The Iris Xe reports minSubgroupSize 8 /
maxSubgroupSize 32 and picks a width per shader; a probe agreed at
n=1,2,31,32,33,37 on every head while the same kernel object produced NaN
logits inside a real submission of two or more blocks, differently run to run.
The width is pinned at pipeline creation since.

**`PrepHead`'s own head split.** The fixed per-token device cost rose with NEmbd
(0.010 ms at 288, ~1.0 ms at 2048) and was flat across an 8x span of
vocabulary. A global JITLLM_GPU_SPLIT sweep lost to the tuner at every forced
value (+0.3% to +11.9%), which is why the head got a split of its own.

**`Layers` / graph capture.** One submission carries the whole prefix of blocks
-- 18 on gemma, ~500 launches -- where one block per call cost a drain per block
and put the residual on the bus 36 times a token to move 8 KB. ~450 launches at
~2.4 us is ~1.07 ms of a 7.1 ms tinyllama token, which the CUDA graph pays once.

**`canRecord` score-width rounding to 128.** ~5.7M FMA a token of surplus on
tinyllama against a 7.1 ms token, a re-capture once per 128 tokens. On a
backend with no Recorder the same rounding would run up to 128x the attention
work at the first token, so only a recording backend pays it.

**`layersOnce`, V100 prefill.**
- The head folded into a batched chunk's last row: it had been a second
  submission, 1.6 ms for the head's own session plus a 4 MB readback
  (Qwen3-1.7B, pp512).
- ActF16 conversion once per source and layout: 7.6 ms of a 152 ms
  Llama-3.1-8B prefill for 224 conversions where 128 differ.
- No int8 quantize on a block whose every batched matvec is on sm_70's f16
  path: the quantizes were 6.8 ms of that 152 ms prompt (2.6 alone, the rest
  inside the fused norm).
- The logits read straight into the caller's slice: the Go copy out of
  bs.hRaw was 128256 floats a token for a llama-3 head, 330 us of a V100 token
  on a two-socket host (pprof, layersOnce's own time).

**Correctness readings behind `layersOnce` / `prepLayer` / `mvrunAct`.**
- mvrunAct names the float source: a chained matvec on a float model read the
  block's residual, NMSE 0.796 against the host with all blocks placed.
- A post-attention norm writing bs.h while the quantize re-read it (RULE 13)
  corrupted gemma2/gemma3 at NMSE 0.09-0.32.
- The row count Conv1dShift reads is nrow, not R: a ragged 88-row chunk runs a
  96-row grid, and the padding went through the recurrence -- the qwen3next
  fixture's first decoded token after a 600-token batched prefill read logit
  NMSE 1.27 (TestHybridPrefillBatchesOnTheDevice). Written from inside emit it
  was also a memcpy inside a stream capture (CUresult 901), so every hybrid
  had run with graphs off.
- The recurrent parity flips per ROW of a batched call: held still, prefill
  logit NMSE 0.07-0.42 once hybrid captures stopped failing.
- The fused q/k/v kernel built before the biases took no bias parameters and
  was launched with three: logit NMSE 1.44 on qwen2 whenever the tuner kept
  split 1 (CUDA does not check the count).
- A recurrent block batched with one-row launches read prefill NMSE 4.3e-01 on
  the qwen3next fixture (TestHybridPrefillOnDeviceDoesNotDemote).
- `declineWeights` / row ranges of a packed tensor: Phi-3.5-mini on CUDA
  answered "The capital of France is" with 264 repeated eleven times, all 32
  blocks placed.
- The attention output's quantize (`quantE` built for NEmbd): both qwen3moe
  models are the first where nHead*headDim differs -- 16x128 against 1024 and
  32x128 against 2048.
- `TestContainerAgreesHostAndDevice`'s near-tie allowance: a mixture read "." at
  18.6352 against "," at 18.6052 on this box, and two CUDA runs picked
  differently.

**Scratch sizes.**
- `batchWidthFor`, vision: the score buffer grows as patches squared, 50.3 MiB
  for SmolVLM-256M's 1024 patches and 12 heads.
- The packed V cache: llama-2-7b's cache is 512 KB a position in f32, and
  halving V takes 2.1 GB at 4096 positions to 1.6 GB on a 4 GB card.
- `kvPair.value`, MLA: storing value apart from key would write ~1.1 GB twice
  at an 8K context on DeepSeek-V3.

**KV capacity (`kvCapFor`, `ensureKVCap`, `regrowKV`, `initKVCap`).**
- Reserving the whole MaxSeq 131072 up front cost 537 MB a block, and the card
  ran 3 of 16 blocks on a 2 GiB budget; hence growth by doubling.
- `capped`: bs.att and bs.prob at 128 rows, 32 heads and a 131072 context are
  about 4 GiB between them.
- Before initKVCap moved above the first scratch build, a 1146-position run
  built bs.p.MaxSeq 1146 against a kvCap of 256.
- A growth is ~45 ms on a V100 (mostly 64 allocations and 20 recompiles); `run
  -n 1100` took three (256 -> 512 -> 1024 -> 1107), ~1.5% of the run -- hence
  jumping straight to the context asked for when it is within 8x.
- `regrowKV` used to go through the host: 356, 681 and 956 ms for an
  8B's three growths to 1107 positions on a V100, 2.0 s of a 12.6 s decode.

**`embed.go` (the embedding gather rides the next submission).** Gathering and
reading the rows back cost 2.1-3.3 ms for 4 MB on the V100 host (first-touch
faults in a fresh prompt buffer) against the kernel's 57 us; riding the chunk's
Layers call also skips a 0.65 ms upload of x.

**`mlabatch.go`.** Before it, a DeepSeek-V2-Lite prompt went one row at a time
at 123 tok/s against llama.cpp's 2070 (V100). The FMA accumulate over the
latent ran at 0.66 ms a layer (the scores at 5.87 are recorded above).

**`moegroup.go`.**
- Before batching, Qwen3-30B-A3B prefilled at 136 tok/s against llama.cpp's
  1050 (V100).
- `voltaUnit`: at Qwen3-30B's ~32 tokens a run, 128x32 455 us against 128x64
  514.
- No dp4a half on sm_70: on gpt-oss-120b's 6016 padded columns that scratch
  would be ~0.3 GB.
- Biases in the GEMM epilogue: on gpt-oss-20b (nvprof, V100, one 512-token
  chunk) indexedbiasadd was 11.1 ms and gatherrows 3.7 ms of a 147.6 ms prompt.

**`rows.go` (batched decode, V100, Llama-3.1-8B Q4_K_M).**
- `LayersRows`: the prefill twin at 32 rows gave a 1024-row matvec 512 threads,
  and the step was 147-151 ms at every batch size.
- `ragMV`, graphs on, after a warm-up, tok/s at 16/32/64/128 rows: Rowt 2
  734/891/967/1020, Rowt 4 607/822/1005/1116; Tok 4 and 16 lost at every width
  (shipped: Tok 8, Rowt 2 below 64 rows and 4 from there).
- `dot4Split`: at 128-token prefill chunks a 1024-row k/v projection took 458
  us against 532 for a 14336-row one with fourteen times its work; the narrow
  matrices were most of a 0.62 s 512-token prompt.
- `voltaMV`: 14336x4096 Q4_K at 128 tokens, 287 us against the dp4a twin's
  652 (2.3x), MT=2 NT=4 swept against 1-8 x 1-8.
- `voltaTiles`: MT=4 NT=4 over one warp row ran 14336x4096 at 34-37 TMAC/s
  against 30-32 for a 2x2 warp grid (512 tokens).
- Recurrent states sized to the real sequences: Qwen3.5-0.8B's five sequences
  padded to 32 asked for 1.2 GB of states (~2 MB a sequence a block) and were
  refused.

**`chooseSplit` (tier.go), the fitted table, RTX 3050 Ti, GB/s by split, winner
in brackets:**

    k/v      256x2048         10     9    10   [13]   10    11

    lm_head 256128x2048     [162]  155   158   153   148   151

The rule "about 2x the thread slots, cap at 32" landed on or beside the winner
except k/v, a 0.04 ms gap at its 11.8 MB a token. Swept against a 148 GB/s wall
on gemma's shapes, what the rule cost (the case for `tuneSplit`):

    shape                rule      best     lost
    qkv    2560x2048     32: 62    8: 73     15%
    o      2048x2048     32: 54    4: 62     13%
    gate/up 16384x2048    4: 134   1: 152    12%
    ffn_down 2048x16384  32: 125   8: 136     8%
    lm_head 256128x2048   1: 162   1: 162     --

~1.06 ms of a 13.7 ms gemma token.

**`tuneSplit` / `timeSplitMode` / `retuneDecode` / `splitCands` (split.go).**
- The msl override, since removed, read: table split 332.9 ms for a 32-token decode
  against the measured split's 354.6 (6.5% slower). It was timing the enqueue
  (Metal `Sync` did not wait); see the Metal entries above.
- In-group reduction on an M4: +39% on q/o (2048x2048), +34% on k/v, -12% on a
  Q6_K head -- so it is timed per shape, not switched.
- Single-matrix trials on a V100 picked 2048x2048 split 4 in-group at 11.0 us
  a launch in one process and split 32 at 4.8 in the next. The decode sequence
  (16 blocks) streams 38 MB of the smallest shape, past a V100's 6 MB of L2.
- Divisors, not powers of two: gpt-oss's k of 2880 is 90 blocks, and the
  power-of-two walk left its 512x2880 k/v projections at split 2 with as few
  as 1,024 threads, 31 us each (~50 GB/s) on a V100.
- The indexed split was a 3050 Ti table: on a V100 gpt-oss's gate/up/down ran
  at split 2 over 11,520 rows -- 23,040 threads for 163,840 slots -- at 357
  GB/s, where llama.cpp's MUL_MAT_ID moves the same bytes at 535.
- `segLaunch` / fused epilogues: kernels.IndexedBiasAdd is 2.3 us each on a
  V100, 0.16 ms of a 5.7 ms gpt-oss token. MLA's kv_a projection (576 rows)
  alone is a 6.2 us launch reading 0.68 MB (~110 GB/s, V100 nvprof,
  DeepSeek-V2-Lite), beside a 3072-row q projection on the same input.

**The per-matvec path (tier.go `matVec`, `prepare`, `quantPar`, `verify`).**
- Two uploads, a launch and a readback were four ownership hops at 5.62 us
  each; batched they are one.
- quantPar fanned 2048 floats (64 blocks) over six goroutines at 46 us a
  quantization, where a serial pass is a couple.
- `verify` reported per-row relative error first and flagged 2-11% of rows on
  llama-2-7B -- the metric failing near cancellation; it uses NMSE.

## The GPU JIT's founding measurements -- one IR, three backends, and a tile that does not transfer

Moved from ARCHITECTURE.md (§5a and §5a-bis) when that file was retired; nothing
else recorded them. Paths and names were checked against the tree at that move. At the time the
driver libraries were reached through purego and the tier lived in a second Go module; today the FFI
is goffi (`jit/gpu/ffi`) and there is one module. Every number below is from the tier's first measurements and predates
whole-block submission (RULE 12), so it describes kernels, not tokens.

**The design said the GPU tier needed no generated code, and the first prefill probe reversed that.**
The claim was made about DECODE, where one hand-written `__dp4a` kernel already read 169.7 GB/s (96%
of the RTX 3050 Ti's theoretical) against 17.5 GB/s for the "obvious" f32-dequantize-then-FMA kernel
-- a memory-bound matvec leaves a generator nothing to win. Prefill is compute-bound.
`dev/probe/gpu` generates an int8 GEMM as PTX at run time with K, the register tile and the output
stride baked as immediates, and swept the tile on the 3050 Ti, every entry bit-exact against an int32
CPU reference:

    tile    Gmac/s        tile    Gmac/s
    1x1      133.8        8x4      887.9
    2x2      260.9        4x8      935.9
    4x2      495.5        8x8     1508.2
    4x4      479.8        8x16   ~2447 (median of four runs; one run read 2497.8)
                          16x8    2349.3

**18.7x from the tile alone**, against 1.63x for the same sweep on the CPU (`TestGEMMTileSweep`).
ptxas owns register allocation, but the TILE is a source-level decision the generator makes. The probe
also measured codegen plus ptxas at 8-28 ms per shape against ~18 us for the CPU emitter; the driver's
on-disk cache keyed on the PTX text (`~/.nv/ComputeCache`, see `jit/gpu/cuda/api.go`) is what makes a
second process pay 0.108 ms instead of 36.7. One more constraint came out of the probe and is why the
PTX emitter writes `.version 7.8`: nvcc 12.9 emitted `.version 8.8`, which driver 550.163.01 (CUDA
12.4, maximum ISA 8.4) rejected at RUN time with "compiled with an unsupported toolchain".

**Then the IR.** `jit/gpu/ir` is a typed IR (about two dozen ops on that day) lowered by three
backends: `ptx` (run through `jit/gpu/cuda`), `spirv` (`jit/gpu/vulkan`) and `msl`
(`jit/gpu/metal`). Verified on the RTX 3050 Ti (PTX and Vulkan), Intel Iris Xe, llvmpipe and the
Apple M4. Three things it established:

1. **Buffers are indexed by element, not addressed by byte pointer.** Byte-pointer arithmetic is a
   PTX-ism; SPIR-V's Logical addressing model has no raw pointers and Metal has the same shape. The
   move cost PTX one `mad.wide.u32` per load and bought two targets. (That per-load widening is
   priced later in this file, under RULE 12's "every Load widens its own 64-bit address".)
2. **Apple's GPU has no packed int8 dot product.** `metal.TestPackedDotIntrinsic` puts four candidate
   spellings to the M4's compiler and all four are rejected, so the Apple int8 inner loop is roughly
   4x the arithmetic of the other targets.
3. **`spirv-val` is a gate, not a lint.** Two emitter bugs -- `OpVariable` with its result type and
   result id swapped, and `PackedVectorFormat4x8Bit` written as 1 where it is 0 -- each crashed
   NVIDIA's compiler inside `vkCreateComputePipelines` with a SIGSEGV and no diagnostic; the validator
   named each in one line. `jit/gpu/spirv/spirv_test.go` runs it when it is installed.

**Bit-exact across five GPU stacks and three vendors, not within tolerance.** int8 x int8 into int32 is
integer arithmetic, so two correct backends agree to the last bit, and a tolerance would have hidden
exactly the bugs these backends had: an access chain off by one element, a phi wired to the wrong back
edge, a packed dot reading its operands in the wrong order -- each of which yields a plausible number.

Throughput (`dev/tools/gpubench`, 4096x2048 x 128 tokens = 1073.7 Mmac a launch, five warm-up
launches then 21 timed rounds, median with IQR, every tile checked against the full 524,288-output
int32 reference first):

| device | API | best tile | Gmac/s | IQR/med | launch overhead |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RTX 3050 Ti | ptx | 8x16 | 2468.0 | 0.013 | 19.3 us |
| RTX 3050 Ti | spirv | 8x16 | 1368.2 | 0.101 | 84.7 us |
| Apple M4 | msl | 8x4 | 343.3 | 0.008 | 288.8 us |
| Iris Xe (ADL GT2) | spirv | 4x8 | 136.1 | 0.009 | 494.2 us |
| llvmpipe | spirv | 4x2 | 26.3 | 0.010 | 115.7 us |

**The best tile differed on every device, and the wrong one is expensive.** NVIDIA's 8x16 run on the
M4 measured 152.1 against 343.3, a 2.26x loss, which the missing packed dot predicted. The best tile
also moves with problem SIZE: at 512x512x32 the best PTX tile was 4x2, because large tiles cannot fill
the GPU. A tile table is not portable across devices or shapes.

**Host-visible Vulkan buffers cost 8x.** The first version mapped everything host-visible and read 172
Gmac/s against CUDA's 2478 on the same card. The arithmetic named it: 6.2 ms a launch, and a 4096x2048
weight re-read once per token tile (128 tokens at TN=16 is eight passes) is 64 MB, which over PCIe at
~10 GB/s is 6.4 ms. Staging through a host-visible scratch buffer took it to 1368, 8.0x;
`vulkan.Buf.DeviceLocal()` reports which path a buffer took. Of CUDA's remaining 1.8x over Vulkan on
that card, dispatch alone was 20% (84.7 against 19.3 us per launch on a ~0.43 ms kernel).

**CPU against GPU on the same int8 GEMM** (Q8_0, k=2048, best tile, 21 rounds with samples padded to
~5 ms; the CPU side is `nn.TestGEMMPoolRate` across the whole P-core pool, because comparing a GPU
with ONE core overstates it by the core count):

| machine | CPU GEMM | GPU GEMM | GPU/CPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| i9-12900HK + RTX 3050 Ti | 681.3 Gmac/s (6 P-cores, IQR 6.6%) | 2468.0 (ptx, IQR 1.3%) | 3.62x |
| i9-12900HK + Iris Xe | 681.3 | 136.1 (spirv, IQR 0.9%) | 0.20x |
| Apple M4 mini | 454.0 (4 P-cores, IQR 1.4%) | 343.3 (msl, IQR 0.8%) | 0.76x |

The M4 row is a statement about that KERNEL SHAPE, not about the hardware: `msl` then emitted a naive
register-tiled kernel with no threadgroup memory and no matrix units, while `metal.TestSimdgroupMatrix`
already showed `simdgroup_float8x8`/`simdgroup_half8x8` multiply-accumulate, threadgroup memory and simd
reductions compiling on the M4. 343 was a floor for that kernel; the simdgroup_matrix prompt GEMM is
the M4 Metal-rows entry above. The Iris Xe shares the P-cores' 55.7 GB/s memory, so it adds no bandwidth;
the placement consequence is measured in AGENTS.md's Scope section (+10.2% with the discrete card,
-15% with the iGPU). The darwin single-core CPU arm came back at IQR/median 50.8% and "135% of
linear" and was not quoted: with no thread affinity on macOS one goroutine migrates between P and E
cores, while four busy workers hold the P-cores.

## Paged KV decode kernels against the contiguous ones

The paged writers and decode kernels (docs/design/device-kv-paging.md) were
built beside the contiguous ones -- which emit byte-identical IR after the
change -- and measured against them kernel for kernel: same pass, A/A control
first (0.997-1.004, IQR/median under 5%), each arm rotating through per-layer
KV so reads come from DRAM, P=256 with shuffled pages, the contiguous K stride
n+1 as in the tier. Llama-3.2-1B and Qwen3.5-0.8B decode shapes at 512 / 4096 /
16384 keys, paged/contiguous (above 1 is paged faster):

    FlashDecodeKV (CUDA/Metal default)
      CUDA 3050 Ti   0.994 / 1.018 / 1.045    1.002 / 1.026 / 1.090   133 GB/s = 80% of 166
      V100           0.990 / 1.010 / 1.034    0.980 / 0.996 / 1.027   631 GB/s = 77% of 822
      Metal M4       1.024 / 1.040 / 1.037    1.083 / 1.147 / 1.070    71 GB/s = 69% of 104
      Vulkan RTX     0.957 / 1.024 / 1.088    0.974 / 1.023 / 1.102
    staged, bounded chunks + merge (Vulkan's default path)
      CUDA           1.10 / 1.27 / 2.93       1.014 / 1.57 / 2.83     86-90% of wall
      Vulkan RTX     1.07 / 1.09 / 2.78       1.03 / 1.35 / 2.70      81-84%
      M4             1.28 / 1.40 / 2.36       1.38 / 2.21 / 2.90      85-94%

Where paged is slower: FlashDecodeKV at 512 keys by 1-4% on CUDA, the V100 and
Vulkan RTX -- one dependent load at kernel start (descriptor, table, K) that the
ABI makes unavoidable; and staged on the V100 at 512/4096 keys with the laptop's
split choice (0.62-0.79), which is the split count, not the kernel: at 64 splits
it reads 1.16-1.23 at 4096. The split has to follow the SM count, as
flashSplitFor already follows Slots. The Iris Xe runs both arms at 1-16% of its
wall and uses neither kernel.

Three findings about the kernels that ship, left untouched by that work:

- **Contiguous FlashAttention loses 3.4x on 256-wide heads**: it interleaved its
  V loads with their FMAs. Grouping them as the paged form does was worth
  1.47-1.67x on PTX and the paged form is still 2.0-2.4x ahead, so it was not
  the whole difference (see "Faster paged decode attention").
- **Staged is the fastest decode at long context on the RTX 3050 Ti**: paged
  staged at 16384 keys is 1.8x paged FlashDecodeKV there, the path CUDA takes by
  default. On a V100 FlashDecodeKV wins at every depth but the 256-wide head at
  16384 keys; the crossover is the device's ("Faster paged decode attention").
- **The fastest K addressing is per driver**: one base plus constant offsets on
  Metal, each index computed on NVIDIA's Vulkan (the other way runs at 0.36x),
  within a point on PTX -- hence FlashShape.KImm.

### The tier on paged history, against the contiguous cache

Decode and a batch's sequences read through paged FlashDecodeKV, a prefill
chunk through the paged prefill kernels (below), a window is the descriptor's
keyStart, and the contiguous cache is the control arm. The accuracy table was
taken with prefill on FlashDecodeKV; with the prefill kernels the Llama arm is
bit-identical to the contiguous one on the laptop. CUDA (RTX 3050 Ti), page 64, the same ids
fed to both arms, worst logit NMSE over every step:

    Llama-3.2-1B, 92-token prompt + 24     gemma-3-1b, 902-token prompt + 24
    paged vs contiguous       2.1e-03      paged vs contiguous       1.0e-02
    contiguous vs host        3.9e-03      contiguous vs host        8.5e-03
    paged vs host             1.7e-03      paged vs host             7.5e-03
    row at a time, paged
      vs contiguous           0            (window) 7.7e-03
    order-only control        2.1e-03      order-only control        6.3e-03
    argmax flips              0            argmax flips              0

The order-only control is the contiguous cache against itself at two split
counts: nothing but the summation order moves, and it moves Llama's logits by
2.1e-03 and gemma's by 6.3e-03. That is the model's own sensitivity, so the
gate's bound is that control measured in the same run, not a constant; a first
bound of 1e-4 was a guess and failed on arithmetic that was right.

- **Without a window the paths are bit-identical, row at a time.** The chunked
  prefill gap is the contiguous prefill scoring in binary16 on the matrix
  units, and paged sits closer to the host (1.7e-03 against 3.9e-03).
- **With a window they are not, and that is order.** Inside gemma's 512-key
  window the rows are bit-identical too; past it, the contiguous kernel starts
  its tiles at the window's first key and the paged one at the 32-aligned
  position below it, masked. Same keys, a different summation grouping.
- **The gate discriminates.** Under each violation the paged arm lands far
  outside the band: a page index of (t-1)/P 239x, unaligned tiles 75x, a
  windowed layer reading the full descriptors 63x, and every batch row reading
  row 0's pages fails the batch gate at its first token by a 2.8-logit gap.

### Prefill on pages: the kernels were half of it, the pool the other half

Prefill through paged FlashDecodeKV measured 0.46-0.48 of the contiguous cache
on the V100 (Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M, 512 and 4096 tokens): one row per descriptor,
every row reading its keys on its own. A chunk is one sequence's rows in order,
so the paged prefill kernels serve it -- FlashPrefill70 at whole 64-row chunks
on sm_70 and FlashPrefillTile on Metal, else the staged scores, softmax and
accumulate (m16n8k16, sm_70's m8n8k4, or the FMA tiles), built per span of
keys from 64 up and run in passes of 4096 keys past that. That took the V100 to
0.48 at 512 and 0.69 at 4096 -- and a CPU profile put a third of the process in
`allocLayerPool`: every request grew each layer's pool and shrank it again on
close. With released pages kept in the pool (the design doc's Shrink), same
binary otherwise, V100 CUDA, same-pass ABBA, paged/contiguous:

    prefill   512 tokens   1.1127 / 1.1106   IQR 0.6-0.8%   A/A 1.0008
              4096 tokens  1.5821 / 1.5770   IQR 0.9-1.3%   A/A 0.9957
    decode    512 deep     0.9755 / 0.9803   44% of the 822 GB/s wall
              4096 deep    0.9934 / 0.9969   49%

The prefill A/A read 1.12 and 1.06 before; the churn was its noise too. The
gates: every prefill violation fires on both hosts -- (t-1)/P 271x (673x on the
V100), unaligned 40x, a window lost 65x, and a pass reading every key
(`passclip`) 53x -- with the clean batched arm inside the band. The laptop row
is not taken: its card was shared with another session throughout.


## Paged KV prefill kernels against the contiguous ones

The paged prefill kernels (docs/design/device-kv-paging.md, "Prefill") were
built beside the contiguous ones -- whose IR is pinned byte for byte by
kernels.TestContiguousPrefillIRUnchanged -- and measured against the path the
tier runs on each device: one 512-row chunk (256 at 16384 keys on Llama, where
the contiguous planes would not fit a 4 GB card twice), same pass, A/A control
first, two ABBA passes of 20 rounds, P=256 shuffled, the contiguous K
transposed at stride n+1. The rate is attention GFLOP/s (two products of
2*Dim flops per row, head and attended key). paged/contiguous, above 1 paged
faster, Llama-3.2-1B then Qwen3-1.7B:

    * Qwen at 16384 on CUDA is the take before the tile-limited softmax, which
      only removes paged work; the re-take ran out of the 4 GB card.

A/A controls 0.99-1.01 on every row. IQR/median 0.0-0.7% on the V100 and the
M4, 1.6-7.6% on the laptop's shared card; every quoted pass under the 10% gate
and the two passes within 1.4 points. The m16n8k16 scores run at 530-590
GFLOP/s contiguous and 610-780 paged on the laptop; m8n8k4 at 4.6-6.9 TFLOP/s
on the V100; FlashPrefill70 at 12.9-23.9 TFLOP/s; FlashPrefillTile at
1.2-2.2 TFLOP/s on the M4.

Why the paged staged path is faster where it is: the contiguous scores
compute every key tile of the context-wide plane and mask half of a causal
chunk; the paged m16n8k16 and m8n8k4 scores skip a tile none of their rows
attends (1.11x on the tiled scores alone on Vulkan, 1.03 on the V100). The
softmax reads and writes only the slots its query tile attends, and at long
context the contiguous softmax makes three passes over a plane of the whole
context -- 1.08 GB at 16384 keys -- where the paged one works on a pass.

What was slower and what it was:

- **The first staged softmax wrote every slot of every chunk**, twice what a
  short-context row attends, and the merge read S partials per element: 0.44x
  the contiguous softmax on Vulkan at 512 keys, 0.80x the whole path on the
  V100. Writing only the query tile's span and the direct form (Splits 0:
  normalised in the softmax, no partials, no merge) took the V100 to 0.93-0.95
  and every other device to a win.
- **A division by a power-of-two constant is a whole division on sm_70.** The
  PTX lowering hands div.u32 its divisor in a register and ptxas emits I2F,
  MUFU.RCP and a correction even for 4; the paged kernels divide by their
  tiles and aligns throughout. With shifts: the m8n8k4 accumulate 720 -> 576
  SASS instructions, the V100 staged path at 512 keys 0.947 -> 0.978 (Llama).
- **The m8n8k4 accumulate first read a page id per 4-key step**: 0.87-0.93
  per kernel. Walking each page's run of keys by pointer -- an outer loop over
  pages, the inner loop identical in SASS to the contiguous kernel's (64
  instructions) -- took it to 0.95 / 0.89; what remains is the masked first
  and last steps and the prologue's dependent loads (descriptor, table, V).
- **The softmax in groups of two warps and with divisions**: 0.88 / 0.90 per
  kernel on the V100; a warp a workgroup and shifts, 0.98 / 0.96.
- **Hoisting FlashPrefill70's staging addresses out of the tile loop cost
  registers and 4 points** (0.965 -> 0.926 at 512 keys, Llama); reverted. The
  same hoist helps FlashPrefillTile on Metal (0.915 -> 0.922 at d128, 0.98 ->
  1.01 at d64).
- **The flash kernels read a page id per key tile**, prefetched a tile ahead.
  FlashPrefillTile at head width 128 (16-key tiles) sat at 0.89-0.93 on the M4
  at every context length and at P=64 (0.90) as at P=256 (0.89), so not the
  page stride; a probe that read one constant page for every tile (wrong
  answers, right traffic) ran 1.06 / 1.09, which put the cost on the table
  read -- a dependent load at the head of every trip. An outer loop over the
  run's pages with the tiles in an inner loop reads the id once a page:
  FlashPrefillTile 0.93 -> 0.99 at d128 (1.00 -> 1.00-1.01 at d64), and
  FlashPrefill70 on the V100 0.951 -> 0.964 (512 keys), 0.957 -> 0.971 (4096),
  0.973 -> 0.983 (16384) at d64 and within half a point at d128 (0.993 ->
  0.994, 0.993 -> 0.987, 0.971 -> 0.967). What FlashPrefill70 keeps on the
  V100 is the prologue: descriptor, then table, then the first K tile, two
  dependent loads the contiguous kernel does not have. The paged decode
  kernels record the same at 512 keys.
- **An unmasked start for the m8n8k4 accumulate** -- a masked head step only
  when keyStart is not 4-aligned, the middle by pointer from there -- measured
  0.5 points slower on the V100 (the accumulate alone 0.952 -> 0.945 Llama,
  0.895 -> 0.891 Qwen; the path 0.978 -> 0.973, 0.940 -> 0.934); reverted. The
  staged path at 512 keys on the V100 is what misses the bar: the accumulate
  at 0.95 / 0.89 is most of it, and its inner loop is the contiguous one's to
  the SASS instruction, so what is left is the per-row masked first and last
  steps and the descriptor and table loads ahead of them. At 4096 keys the
  same path wins.

Correctness: the gates (backend/pagedprefill*_test.go) pass on the laptop's
CUDA, Vulkan RTX and Iris Xe, the V100 and the M4 -- shuffled tables,
NaN-poisoned pools, planes and outputs, page edges, keys ending mid-page,
windows and aligned chunks, padded rows, sinks, softcap, GQA, packed f16 V,
MLA's row-major region, the direct form, split counts past the keys, passes
-- against the float64 oracle (1e-10 FMA, 1e-5 binary16 operands) and the
contiguous kernels (6e-8 at worst), and each fails through a wrong table,
keyEnds one short, a dropped pass, and the generation faults (t-1)/P,
unaligned and vmask.

### Every staged prompt on Metal was wrong, and every kernel gate was green

The tier launched the staged prefill softmax 64 wide. With 32 lanes the
kernel is a 32-wide workgroup an item (`kernels.PagedPrefillSoftmaxWidth`):
CUDA and Vulkan keep the declared width and were right, and Metal runs a
launch at the width it is given, so two subgroups worked one item. Every
prompt chunk of two or more tokens through the staged form prefilled wrong on
the M4: Qwen3.5-0.8B's full-attention blocks (head width 256, which no flash
prefill takes there) read **0.38** logit NMSE against the same prompt a
token at a time, against 2e-4 to 6.5e-4 on CUDA and Vulkan. The dense board
models never reached it -- their heads take FlashPrefillTile on Metal --
and the backend gates launch each kernel at its own width, so they could not
see it. It was found because a step-across-sessions gate compared a chunked
prompt against Prefill on the same device, and the reference was the wrong
arm. The tier keeps each staged variant's width now (`prefillVariant.softW`):
0.38 -> 2.5e-4 on the M4. Gate: `model.TestStagedPagedPrefillMatchesDecode`.

### A launch at a width the kernel does not declare is refused on every backend

The same mismatch came back the other way round: `kernels.HCMix` declared a
64-thread workgroup and the tier launched it 128 wide, so CUDA (which runs the
launch's width) was right and Vulkan (which runs the SPIR-V's LocalSize and
ignores the launch's) computed the first 64 rows of every 128 and left the rest
stale, with no error and a clean validation layer. Each backend answers a
mismatch differently -- CUDA the launch's width, Vulkan the declared one,
Metal the launch's while msl bakes the declared one into ir.OpNTID -- so the
class is closed at the backend rather than kernel by kernel: every
`Kernel.Launch` and `Session.Launch` on CUDA, Vulkan and Metal refuses a width
other than the kernel's declared `Group[0]` (or a group with a second or third
dimension, which no one-dimensional launch can match), naming the kernel
(`backend.checkWidth`), and the model's device-failure errors carry the
device's reason, so the name reaches the caller.
`backend.TestEveryBackendRefusesALaunchWiderThanItsKernel` launches a 64-wide
kernel at 64 (every row written), 128 and 32 through both paths. The 64-wide
`HCMix` put back fails `TestDeepseek4LongChunksOnEveryDevice` on cuda:0 too
now, which it passed before, with "hcmix declares a 64x1x1 workgroup and was
launched 128 wide"; the "softwidth" fault (jitllmfault, the staged softmax
launched 64 wide) is refused by name on cuda:0, vulkan:0 and vulkan:1
(`TestStagedPagedPrefillGateDiscriminates`).

To find any other kernel with the mismatch, every `engine/model` test that
opens a device tier (270), and the `jit/gpu/tier` and `jit/gpu/backend`
packages, ran with every refusal logged: on the RTX 3050 Ti's cuda:0 and
vulkan:0, and on the V100 box in eight slices, one card each (cuda:0 and
vulkan:k), plus the tier package. The log held the deliberate violations and
nothing else: no other kernel is launched at a width it does not declare.

## Faster paged decode attention

Each technique was built behind the paged gates and measured against the form
before it with `backend.TestFlashChangeAB` (`JITLLM_FLASH_EXP` names the
experiment; `-tags jitllmbench`): one decode environment, both arms reading
per-layer KV so the reads come from DRAM, A/A first, two ABBA passes of 20
rounds, the read wall measured in the same process. Shapes are Llama-3.2-1B
(32/8 heads, 64 wide) and Qwen3.5-0.8B (8/2, 256 wide), one row, at 512 /
4096 / 16384 keys, P=256 with shuffled pages. Ratios are after/before (above 1
is the change faster); "u" marks a pass above the 10% IQR gate. Devices: RTX
3050 Ti under CUDA (166 GB/s wall, 30720 resident threads) and under
NVIDIA's Vulkan driver, a V100 under CUDA (822 GB/s, 163840), and the M4
under Metal (104 GB/s). An alternative emission is compiled in only under the
bench tag (`kernels.SetBenchKnob`); a deliberate violation of each shipped
change is a `jitllmfault` generation fault that `TestPagedGatesDiscriminate`
demands fail.

**binary16 K (`FlashShape.F16K`).** K is half of what a decode reads from the
cache with f32 V and two thirds with f16 V, and it was always f32: the tier's
own comment said the NEOX rotation, whose outputs are half a head apart, stood
in the way. The layout packs two DIMENSIONS of one position into a word --
`[kvRow/2][P]` words a page, the pair (e, e+1) of position t at
`pid*P*kvRow/2 + (e/2)*P + t%P` -- so a writer always writes whole words:
`PagedCopyRowsTF16` a pair a thread, `PagedRoPERowsTF16` one interleaved
pair or two adjacent NEOX pairs (four dimensions, two words; nRot a multiple
of 4) a thread, and no two threads ever share a word. The three decode
readers (FlashDecodeKV, the staged scores, paged FlashAttention) read a word
for two dimensions where a slice is whole pairs and a half by parity where it
is not (a 34-wide head's 17-wide slices). f32 V's byte ceiling is 1.33x; the
rows sit at 1.04-1.30x, and Metal passes it (1.65x at Qwen's 4096 keys) where
halving the K loads relieves an issue-bound phase as well as the bus. What it
costs is precision -- K rounded to binary16 changes every score -- which is
llama.cpp's default cache and is the model-level gate's to price, not this
bench's. Gated with shuffled pages, windows, sinks, softcap, f16 V beside it,
the 256-wide head and the odd slice on CUDA and Vulkan; halves read high
first fail at NMSE 0.15-1.03, and a NEOX rotation that swaps a word's halves
fails the writer gate. Prefill's paged kernels (attn.go, flash70.go,
flashtile.go) do not read it yet, and the tier cannot turn it on before they do.

**ChooseDecodePlan** is the combination the rows below it motivated, measured
against what the tier runs now (FlashDecodeKV at `flashSplitFor` with the
group-per-item merge on CUDA and Metal; the staged path at sqrt(n/8) splits on
Vulkan). The path: staged where keys x Dim reaches 24 x the resident threads on
PTX and Metal (Metal at its 16384-thread fallback), from 16384 keys on
Vulkan; the KV plan takes four warps past 128 dims at 4096 keys (16384 on
Vulkan, never on Metal), the split cap rounded up, and the wide merge; the
staged plan raises
sqrt(n/8) until the accumulate fills a quarter of the device. Every cell is
at or above parity (0.998 the lowest), and the long-context 256-wide rows are
where it pays: 1.58x and 1.91x on the RTX 3050 Ti, 1.52x and 1.83x on the
V100, 1.76x and 2.29x on the M4 -- 86-89% of the laptop's wall, 74% of the
V100's and 89-95% of the M4's, where the tier's choice sat at 40-55%.

**Why the path depends on the device, not only the shape.** Paged staged
against paged FlashDecodeKV, each at its plan (above 1 is staged faster):

    RTX 3050 Ti CUDA   0.86 / 0.77 / 1.08u    0.79 / 1.25 / 1.39
    RTX 3050 Ti Vulkan 0.95 / 0.76 / 1.03     0.70 / 0.93 / 1.73   (*)
    V100               0.51 / 0.72 / 0.92     0.39 / 0.72 / 1.16
    M4 Metal           0.94 / 1.03 / 1.23     0.87 / 2.01 / 2.10   (**)
    (**) against FlashDecodeKV with four warps, which Metal does not want
         at 4096 keys (0.88x); against its default width, 1.76x there
    (*) the staged path at sqrt(n/8) against FlashDecodeKV at the tier's
        rule; the Vulkan plans are the same but for four warps, which
        that driver does not want below 16384 keys

The crossover moves by four between two NVIDIA parts (keys x Dim of about 1M
on the 3050 Ti, 4M on the V100) and by API on one card. FlashDecodeKV holds a
chunk of scores in shared memory and a workgroup takes one; the staged path
is four launches with a plane between them. A small part fills with either
and the staged path's higher read rate wins at depth; a large one needs the
staged path's thread count, which the square-root split did not give it. A
tier that can time both on its own pools at the split thresholds should, and
ChooseDecodePlan is the prior for one that does not.

**FlashAttention's contiguous V loads, grouped.** The known 3.4x: the paged
form issued a group of keys' V loads (64 values a lane) before their FMAs and
the contiguous one interleaved them. Grouped, the contiguous kernel reads
1.34x (Llama) and 1.47-1.67x (Qwen) on PTX and nothing on Vulkan, whose
compiler already schedules them. It does not close the gap: paged
FlashAttention is still 2.0-2.4x the contiguous one on Qwen's shape and 0.77x
on Llama's, and an aligned contiguous K stride (4128 in place of 4097) moved
nothing (2.29x), so the rest is not alignment. The kernel is at 2-19% of the
wall at the tier's split of 1 either way; it is the opt-in decode, and the
two that ship are far ahead of it. Gated at head widths 7-256 (96 leaves a
ragged group of 21 keys) with f16 V, windows and sinks; weighting every key of
a group by its first key's probability fails at NMSE 1.40-1.76. The lowertest
goldens flash/split1 and split8 moved with it, after that gate passed on CUDA,
Vulkan and the Iris Xe.

**Tried and refused.** Four independent chains in FlashAttention's score dot,
which a warp per head seemed to want: 0.89-0.96 everywhere but the contiguous
256-wide head (1.05), the extra live registers costing more than the chain
saved. One query head a FlashDecodeKV workgroup (`Group` 1), for a bigger
chunk: 0.72-0.76 at depth except Qwen's shape at 4096 keys (1.12), where four
warps buys the same chunk (1.24) without losing the shared K load. Hoisting the first dependent load (descriptor, table, K) was priced
by baking the descriptor outright, the ceiling of any hoist: at most 1.9% on
PTX and 2.5% on Vulkan at 512 keys, and baking values made NVIDIA's Vulkan
driver 0.64x and 0.84x on Qwen's shape -- the KImm finding again, a constant
that one driver folds and another spills. Not built.

**Not built, and why.** GQA packing is FlashDecodeKV's group and the staged
path's `stagedGroup` already; the one kernel without it, FlashAttention, is a
warp per query head, and giving it a KV head's group is FlashDecodeKV. exp2
with log2e folded: PTX's exp is already `ex2.approx` after one multiply, a
multiply a key in a kernel bound by bytes, and the IR has no exp2 to fold it
into. Skipping fully masked tiles: the decode kernels start at keyStart
rounded down to 32, so no tile is fully masked. Vector K loads: K is
transposed and lanes run over keys, so a vector load would span four keys and
need 128-key tiles (P of 128 or more, a score plane four times wider); vector
V loads bought at most 1.9%, and the K side has the same shape of arithmetic.
A single-page table walk: a tile's page id is one load a tile, loaded a tile
ahead already. vLLM's paged attention v2 and FlashDecoding's split-K are the
splits and the merge these kernels already have; FlashDecoding++'s unified
maximum removes a rescale the two-pass FlashDecodeKV does not do.

**Vector V loads (`FlashShape.VecV`).** A lane loads its V elements as 2- or
4-wide vectors where an f32 row divides across the warp. PTX and MSL lower
vector loads; SPIR-V does not, so the tier sets it per API. 1.0-1.9% on PTX,
nothing on Metal (0.999, 1.001), so PTX only. Crediting a component to the
mirrored dimension fails at NMSE 1.94.

**Splits.** FlashDecodeKV's split sweep on the RTX 3050 Ti and the V100 put
the tier's rule at or near the best everywhere but two places: its cap
rounded DOWN gave a 20-SM part one split for Llama-3.2-1B at 512 keys (2 to 8
read 1.20-1.22x; 16 read 0.82x), and on a 256-wide head the chunk of 256 keys
forced 16-64 splits (fixed by four warps). Other counts than the rule's lose
everywhere they were tried: 0.60-0.87x at 512 on the V100, 0.70-0.92x at
4096 on both parts, 0.61-0.87x at 16384. The staged path's square root starved the V100 (above) and was right
on the RTX 3050 Ti, where 32 splits at 4096 read 0.89x and 0.94x.

**Through the tier, once.** FlashKVPlan's shape reaches the contiguous
FlashDecodeKV the tier runs today (`kvplan=1`: Llama-3.2-1B 1.24 / 1.00 /
1.00, Qwen3.5-0.8B 1.04u / 1.20-1.35u / 1.63 on the RTX 3050 Ti; 1.03 / 1.01 /
1.00 and 1.12 / 1.47 / 1.52 on the V100), and its four-warp rule is one the
tier can already be told: `JITLLM_GPU_FLASH=2 JITLLM_GPU_FLASH_WARPS=4` (the
warps knob is read only beside `JITLLM_GPU_FLASH`, which is why a first pair
of runs with the warps knob alone read 1.002 and 0.982 -- two more A/A
controls). `jitllm run -depth` on Qwen3.5-0.8B, cuda:0, 128 tokens decoded,
one process a sample, ABBA, A/A first:

    depth 4096    A/A 0.9965 (IQR 0.045)   four warps 1.0274 (0.051), 1.0249 (0.052)
    depth 16384   A/A 0.9940 (IQR 0.076)   four warps 1.068 (0.263), 1.034 (0.270)  REJECTED

At 4096 keys the token is 2.5% faster where the arithmetic predicts 3.5%
(six attention layers of 24, ~1.2 ms of a 6 ms token, 1.24x on that). At
16384 both passes blow the gate, and not symmetrically: the old arm holds
88-91 tok/s in every process while the four-warp arm lands near 80 or near
100, process by process -- a per-process choice in that arm that was not
identified, on a card at 74 C and 937 MHz. Unresolved; RULE 2 says rest the
box rather than add rounds. These kernel changes were measured before the
tier ran on pages, and the decode plan (ChooseDecodePlan) is not yet what the
tier chooses, so nothing else here has a decode rate behind it yet.

### The decode plan through the tier, and the harness bias it exposed

With kernels.ChooseDecodePlan choosing each paged decode's path, splits,
width and merge (jit/gpu/tier/pagedattn.go, pagedPlanFor), the V100 first read
2.7% slower than the old split rule at 512 keys -- and every single piece put
back (splits, merge, vector V) read the same 0.972, as did two tiers holding
the SAME plan. The harness was the variable: its one-tier A/A decoded 640
tokens on the paged arm before the A/B, so the paged arm was always measured
~640 positions deeper. Each pass now opens both arms fresh, in alternating
order, behind a two-tier A/A. V100 CUDA, Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M, same pass:

                                512 keys        4096            16384
    two-tier A/A (decode)       1.0013-1.0048   0.9996-1.0015   1.0008-1.0014
    plan / old rule, decode     1.0024 / 0.9987 1.0083 / 1.0024 1.0058 / 1.0068
    paged / contiguous, decode  0.9969 / 0.9968 1.0099 / 1.0057 1.0413 / 1.0422
    paged / contiguous, prefill 1.1039 / 1.1076 1.5841 / 1.5847 1.1545 / 1.1549

So decode on pages is at parity at 512 and ahead from 4096, and the earlier
0.97-0.98 decode rows in this file were the deeper position, not paging.


### The prompt lost 22% on the V100, and none of it was a kernel

The first V100 board on the paged engine read Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M pp512 at
15.3k tok/s against 19.6k on the board before paging, and Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0
19.7k against 21.6k -- while llama.cpp's own rows had not moved. The
in-process A/B had said paged prefill was 1.10x the contiguous path at 512
keys; its contiguous arm was the later engine's, so it could not see a loss
both arms shared.

Bisected on the card, each binary converting its own containers
(`jitllm speed -p 512`, one V100-SXM2-16GB): container v27 moved nothing
(19.5k either side), and the step to paged prefill is where it went. Then,
by elimination:

    nvprof kernel totals, 10 prompts     identical to 1% -- flashprefill70paged
                                         4.59 ms against flashprefill70 4.46
    JITLLM_GPU_SKIP=attn, Qwen3-0.6B     attention costs 3.5 ms of a prompt
                                         paged, 3.9 contiguous
    the device call (layersCall)         26.2 ms -- the old engine's whole prompt
    the prompt                           33.9 ms

So 7.7 ms was the model's, outside the device. Timed phase by phase, 6.6 ms
of it was `growDeviceBatch`: a State's prompt rows, 4 MiB allocated fresh for
every State, faulting in page by page -- and a request is a fresh State, so
every request paid it. The rest was a scratch rebuild: closing a session reset
the scratch's context bound, and `jitllm speed` alternates a 513-position
prompt session with a 3-position decode one, so every prompt after the first
rebuilt the batched scratch inside its timed window (17.4k on a process's
first prompt, 13.7-14.0k on every later one). Paged history sizes nothing by
context, so the bound no longer resets; a closed State's prompt buffers go to
the model for the next one (`promptBuf`).

    V100, pp512, three interleaved rounds       old engine    paged, fixed
    Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M                          19.5-19.9k    18.96-19.07k  0.97
    Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0                              21.5-21.7k    20.1-20.4k    0.94
    tg128, both                                   within 1%

What was left was ~1.5 ms of fixed cost per prompt outside the layer ops on
Qwen3-0.6B (every op skipped: 6.9 ms against 5.4) -- not attention, which is
faster paged. Timed phase by phase on the V100, a 512-row Qwen3-0.6B call
spent 3.4 ms on the host before its first launch:

    pagedAppendRows     1.07 ms   one seqEnd per ROW, then 28 layers x 512
                                  map reads -- for a chunk of ONE sequence
    prepBatch           0.92 ms   ~25 kernel lookups a block, every call, to

    pagedPrep + stage   1.35 ms   the same per-row page check again

Rows collapse to one entry per sequence (`seqEnds`), and the walk runs only
when a block was placed or released (`layerGen`). Batching the page-table
writes into one session per call (`flushTabs`) did not move the rate; it stays
because it removes a hop a layer.

    V100, pp512, two interleaved rounds    pre-paging   paged, fixed
    Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0                        21.5k        23.1k   1.07

    gemma-3-1b Q4_K_M                      15.4-15.7k   16.0k   ~1.03
    Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M                    19.5k        20.3k   1.04

The paged engine now prefills faster than the contiguous one it replaced on
all four, measured on a box whose other cores were running gates -- a
direction, with the board's re-take as the row.

### MLA decode lost 14% on pages, and it was one kernel's lane count

The paged V100 board read DeepSeek-V2-Lite and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite decode
at 160 tok/s, 0.93-0.94 of llama.cpp's 171, where the board before paging had
186.5 and 1.09. `JITLLM_CUDA_KERNEL_TIMING=1` against the pre-paging binary on
the same v27 container put it in one place:

    pre-paging   attnscoreswarp   295 us a token over 27 calls   11 us each
    paged        pagedscores     1063 us                          39 us each

The staged scores kernel has a warp-across-the-dimensions form for exactly
this -- its own comment names "a row-major MLA row" -- and `pagedBuild` asked
for one thread a slot. A latent row is 576 floats, so each thread walked 576
multiply-adds alone. MLA now takes the 32-lane form on a device that
guarantees the width; head rows of 64-256 keep a thread a slot.

    V100, tg128, two interleaved rounds     before    after
    DeepSeek-V2-Lite Q4_K_M                 160.0     183.0   1.07x llama.cpp
    DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite Q4_K_M           159.8     183.5   1.07x llama.cpp

0.98 of the pre-paging 186.5; prefill unchanged at 4.39k.

### Latent attention in the ragged step, and the prompt paths that had never run

Making a step across sessions run MLA blocks (tier/rows.go, mlabatch.go)
meant running the F32 fixtures' prompts as batched chunks for the first time,
and what had been silently falling back a row at a time came out:

- **A float head refused the whole chunk.** The fold (the projection riding
  the chunk's submission) cannot take a float head, and its refusal sent the
  prompt a row at a time -- every F32 fixture on every backend, so no batched
  prompt gate had ever reached them. The chunk now runs, then the head as its
  own submission, as every other fallback already did.
- **A float bank refused the batch.** MLA's absorbs and a mixture's experts
  run grouped; a float bank now reads the float activation in the scale
  plane's slot, as a dense float matvec does, on sm_70 too (moeFloatHalf).
- **A prompt's first device run, failed after a linear block advanced,
  restarted from the embeddings** and applied that block twice: while
  Metal's staged prefill softmax was still launched 64 wide (refused there;
  fixed on main beside this as the "softwidth" fault), synth-kimilinear's
  batched prompt read residual NMSE 1.8 against the rows on the M4. It now
  refuses (errRecurRetry) when the device reports advanced blocks, as decode
  already did, and the head split carries the chunk's count past the head's
  call.

With them, `model.TestLatentPrefillBatchesOnTheDevice` holds the chunk to
the row-by-row device prompt: 1e-13 on the fixtures on CUDA, Vulkan, Metal and
the V100; DeepSeek-V2-Lite p90 4.3e-4 and Moonlight 4.2e-3 on the V100 (the
sm_70 f16 twins); a chunk rotating Kimi-Linear's NoPE channels reads 9.7e-1.
And `model.TestC6OnEveryDevice`'s prompt arm, now batched, meets the binary16
attention tiles: synth-dbrx 4.7e-7 on CUDA's m16n8k16 and 1.2e-6 on Metal's
FlashPrefillTile, 2.9e-12 with the flash tile off; its prompt bound is 1e-5.

## The step across sessions, architecture by architecture

`model.TestStepAcrossSessionsEveryArchitecture` runs the step gate -- three
sessions, eight teacher-forced steps together through `Step`, against each
session decoded alone -- on one model of every architecture on the box, and
fails naming `State.StepRefusal` where a model would not step. A model that
does not step as rows falls back to one session after another, which is the
same logits at a pass over the weights per session: no logit gate sees it,
which is how gemma2 came to never step at all.

### gemma2 never stepped: the per-row head applied no final softcap

`onRowsDevice` refused any model with `FinalSoftcap`, and so did the tier's
ragged head, because decode's head caps on the device (`headCap`) and the
per-row head did not. On the V100 `TestDecodeDoesNotAllocate` with gemma-2-2b
read "0 row(s) stepped across sessions, want 192". The per-row head now caps
the rows it projects into a buffer of their own (`ragCapK`/`ragCap`, the same
`kernels.Softcap` over `R x vocab`, launched over the wanted rows), and the
per-row argmax and the readback take the capped rows. The batched-State rows
paths (`forwardRowsDevice`, `prefillSeqDevice`, `ForwardBatch`'s device head)
finish with `finishDevLogits` for the same reason, where they had relied on
never seeing a cap.

    gemma-2-2b, step against each session alone
    V100 CUDA 1.5e-13   V100 SPIR-V 4.9e-03   3050 Ti SPIR-V 4.9e-03
    Iris Xe 1.3e-13     M4 Metal 1.6e-13      (3050 Ti CUDA: card too small)

A gemma2 step of up to four sessions is decode's arithmetic bit for bit on
CUDA (gemma-2-9b reads 2.3e-13 too). The gate that can run anywhere perturbs
the cap on Llama-3.2-1B, as `TestFinalSoftcapReachesTheDeviceHead` does
(`TestStepAcrossSessionsAppliesTheFinalSoftcap`, a cap of an eighth of the
largest logit): the jitllmfault "nocap" reads 1.46-1.51 on all four devices,
17-51x its bound.

### Speculation over a final softcap

Speculation refused a model with a final softcap, twice (`Speculate` and
`stepRows`), on the reasoning that no model with a prediction block carries
one and building it wanted the cap perturbed on an MTP fixture. Every head a
speculation step's rows reach already capped them -- the device's per-row and
folded heads as decode's does, the host's in `finishRows` -- so the refusals
went and the gate is the perturbation: `model.TestSpecOverAFinalSoftcap`,
synth-qwen35-hybrid-mtp and Qwen3.5-0.8B-MTP-Q8_0 with a cap set from the
largest logit on the first prompt.

A greedy gate cannot see a missing cap: tanh is monotone, so no argmax moves.
Greedy speculation is held to plain greedy decode (64 tokens, three drafts a
round, on the host exactly and on a device up to `devFlip`'s tie) at a cap of
half the largest logit, and the verification's own logits to decode's at an
eighth: four-row steps (`stepRows`, what `Speculator.Next` runs)
teacher-forced along decode's tokens, against decode at the same positions,
the device's bound 8x the same comparison with no cap.

    verify rows vs decode       host  3050 Ti CUDA  SPIR-V   Iris Xe  M4 Metal
    synth-qwen35-hybrid-mtp     0     6.2e-13       5.5e-13  5.1e-13  4.7e-13   (bound 1e-9)
    Qwen3.5-0.8B-MTP-Q8_0       0     1.3e-03       1.2e-03  1.5e-03  2.2e-03   (bound 9.6e-03..1.3e-02)

The cap skipped in the verify rows reads 2.1 and 3.2 on the host
(`rowsOut.noCap`) and 2.1-2.7 on every device (the jitllmfault "nocap",
`TestSpecSoftcapGateDiscriminates`), 248x its bound and up.

The two caps differ because each fails the other check. At an eighth the top
logits saturate to one binary32 value and greedy breaks the exact tie by
index: on the Iris Xe and the M4 the speculative and plain chains parted at
token 1 on a gap of 0.0000, which ended the greedy comparison at one token.
At half, Qwen3.5-0.8B's uncapped verify rows read 3.1e-02-3.3e-02 against a
device bound of ~1e-02: 3x, which does not separate a missing cap from the
band.

### gemma3's local layers, on every rows path, rotated by a stale table

`nn.RowsDevice.LayersRows` and `nn.SessionStepper.LayersSessions` carried one
rotary table, so a model with two bases (gemma3, `SWAPeriod`) handed the
device no local one. The tier's row count for the rotary is the minimum over
both tables, 0, so the step took the upload path with nothing to upload, and
every local layer read whatever `bs.csSWA` last held: the prompt's positions.
gemma-3-1b read 2.953e-01 against each session alone on the 3050 Ti, every
row fluent -- the step across sessions, a batched State on the device, a
batched State's prompt and a speculation step alike. Both interfaces carry
`csSWA` now, `State.ropeRow` fills both tables, and the tier refuses a local
table shorter than the global one by name
(`TestStepRowsRefuseAShortLocalRopeTable`). After:

    gemma-3-1b   3050 Ti CUDA 2.7e-14   SPIR-V 6.9e-04   Iris Xe 5.1e-14
                 V100 CUDA 3.9e-08      SPIR-V 4.7e-04   M4 1.4e-08

The violation hands the step the global table as the local one ("swatab"),
which reaches the kernels only where the device uploads the host's tables
(`RopeTableHost`): 5.4e-02-8.3e-02, 6.4-27x its bound.

### Llama 4 and Cohere2 were refused for a gap that was not there

The tier refused a ragged step over any NoPE-global, weightless-QK-norm or
input-weighted-expert block ("a Llama 4 block, which the ragged path does not
run") while the model reported those States steppable, so `StepRuns` returned
an error on synth-llama4 and synth-cohere2. The batched block already runs
every one of them: an unrotated layer copies k (`copyK`), the weightless norm
rides `l4Ones`, the temperature reads each row's own causal count
(`ScaleRowsByCount` reads `pN[1+r]`, which a ragged step stages as the row's
`pos+1`), the chunk is the paged descriptors', and the grouped mixture has
`actMulW`. The refusal is gone: synth-llama4 3.9e-13 CUDA, 4.9e-13 SPIR-V,
4.1e-13 Metal; synth-cohere2 3.7e-13. Each feature taken out of the step alone
fails the fixture bound (1e-9): unrotated layers rotated ("nope") 1.1e-01 and
5.6e-02, the temperature skipped ("notemp") 6.4e-04, the chunk ignored
("nowin") 2.39 and 1.37, the expert weight on the output ("wout") 1.3e-01.

### The sweep

Worst logit NMSE of the step against each session alone; "card" is a card too
small to hold the model and both arms' histories, "declined" a block the
device does not implement, "--" not run there.

Granite ran on no device until its residual scale was built (the next
section): the tier declined it by name, and this row read "declined".

### Granite on the device: one scaled residual add

Granite is llama's block with four scales. Three needed nothing: the
embedding scale rides the device's tied-row gather (`nn.Head.EmbdScale`), the
attention scale every paged kernel already read off the plan
(`nn.LayerPlan.Scale`), and the logit divisor is applied on the host after the
device's head (`finishDevLogits`). The fourth, residual_scale, was declined:
the device adds a block's output to the residual inside the projection's
epilogue (the residual in the matvec's bias slot, decode's and the ragged
step's), or inside a fused add-and-norm launch, and neither has a scale.

A scaled block (`residScaled`) takes neither fusion now. Its attention and FFN
outputs land in their buffer as a post-normed block's do, and
`kernels.AddScaled` -- x + s*y, s read from a one-element buffer as
`kernels.Scale` reads its alpha -- is the residual add, on decode, a prompt
chunk and a step across sessions alike (`Stats.ResidScaled` counts it). A
mixture's routed weights carry none of it on the device: the scaled add covers
the routed sum and the shared expert at once, where the host folds the scale
into the routed weights (`Config.routedScale`). Two scratches of different
scales on one tier are refused by name (`planConflict`), as two score scales
now are.

The arithmetic is exact. On f32 fixtures with Granite's own scales set
(`model.TestGraniteScalesOnEveryDevice`: synth-qwen2 and synth-mixtral, every
block and the head placed) the device reads 2.6e-14 to 1.7e-11 against the
host on decode and a prompt chunk, and its step across sessions 3.0e-14 to
6.9e-14 against each session alone, on the 3050 Ti's CUDA and SPIR-V, the Iris
Xe and the M4. Each scale dropped reads 8.5e-01 and 3.6e-01 (residual),
8.1e-03 and 1.4e-03 (attention at 1/sqrt(head_dim)), 49 (no logit divisor).

On the real models (`model.TestGraniteOnEveryDevice`, a chunked prompt then
decode, and decode alone, against the host's own greedy ids):

arm at two matvec splits) for the dense model and the mixture step gate's
5e-2 for the mixture. The dense model sits at 2.9x (CUDA), 3.2x (SPIR-V),
4.3x (Iris Xe, which holds it now) and 1.0x (Metal) its control, and the next section is what that ratio is made of:
it was 2.8x, 4.5x and 2.7x before the device's activation quantizer and Metal's
scaled residual add were made the host's bit for bit, and what is left is the
control. Every violation clears its band 10x or more (a mixture's step break:
its band and 10x the clean step, below): residual dropped
2.2-3.0, attention at 1/sqrt(head_dim) 0.87-2.9, embedding scale dropped
2.0-2.5, logit divisor skipped 28-54, and a step whose rows fuse the residual
unscaled (`tier.ScaleFaultStepResidual`, the step's own break, reachable only
on quantized weights) 1.26-6.5.

The attention scale needed no fix and got a correction anyway: the contiguous
score tiles baked 1/sqrt(HeadDim) and not the plan's scale. They are built
only for a vision block since history went paged, where the two agree, so it
was not reachable; every kernel now asks `devTier.scoreScale`.

And the host had an allocation granite alone reached: `nn.(*JIT).packedWindow`
allocated its window tensor and result rows every call, two objects a token on
a model whose head's row count the tail kernel's group does not divide --
granite's 49159-row vocabulary. Both live on the JIT now, and
`TestDecodeDoesNotAllocate` reads 0 for both Granites on the host, CUDA,
SPIR-V and Metal.

### What parted granite-3.3-2b from the host

Two defects and a one-pair control. The defects are the device computing in
the last bit what the host computes otherwise; the control is a single draw
from a spread wider than the excess it was read against.

The probe that found the first is RULE 11c's seam, read one block deep: the
residual after block 0, with block 0 on the device and the rest on the host,
row at a time, against the host, on the gate's own prompt (3050 Ti CUDA):

    residual after block 0     host vs device   split 1 vs split 4
    granite-3.3-2b             6.5e-05          1.6e-13
    Llama-3.2-1B               4.5e-09          1.7e-13

Block 0 reads the embedding, which both tiers have bit for bit, so nothing
but block 0's own arithmetic can part them. On granite every position agreed
to 6e-7 relative until token 2288 at position 6, and every position after it
was 1e-2 relative off: that token's key and value differ, and every later row
attends to them. Vulkan agreed with the host there. Quantizing that token's
attention-norm row in Go both ways moved exactly two int8s: the host derives
an activation block's scale as `d = amax/127` and then `inv = 1/d`, two
divisions (`cpu.QuantizeQ8Window`, whose own comment says why: "not one
multiply by 127/amax, which differs in the last bit"), and `kernels.Quantize`
and `RMSNormQuantRows` took `d = amax*(1/127)` and `inv = 127/amax`. An element
a few ulps from n+0.5 goes to the next int8 when inv is one ulp off.

★ AND THE OBVIOUS FIX IS NOT ONE ON VULKAN: SPIR-V'S DIVISION IS NOT THE IEEE
QUOTIENT. `OpFDiv` is allowed 2.5 ulp, and over 262144 quotients the drivers
here return another last bit for this share of them (87381 of each kind):

                          x/127    1/d     127/x
    3050 Ti SPIR-V        4.5%     13.4%   27.9%
    Iris Xe SPIR-V        4.5%     11.6%   27.2%
    3050 Ti PTX, M4 MSL   0        0       0

PTX's `div.rn` is exact by construction and Metal compiles with IEEE math. An
FMA correction cannot rescue SPIR-V either: `ir.OpFma` lowers there as a
multiply and an add. So the quantizer's scales are rounded in integers now
(`kernels.quantScales`): `div127` divides the mantissa shifted by eight by
127 and rounds on the bits it drops (a float over 127 is never exactly
halfway, so no remainder is needed), and `1/d` starts from 127/amax, taken
beside it, one Newton step against d, and `roundQuotient`, which counts the
midpoints between the floats around the estimate that lie below the true
quotient -- `ma*2^s - (2*Mc+1)*md`, a difference of two products near 2^48
whose low 32 bits are the whole of it because it is a few ulps. Gates:
`kernels.TestQuantScalesAreTheHosts` (every mantissa of a binade and a million
amaxes, bit for bit), `TestDivRNIsTheIEEEQuotient` (a million quotients across
the normal range, binade edges included; the backend's own division differs
in 216174 on the 3050 Ti's Vulkan, 212555 on the Iris Xe's and 0 on PTX and
MSL), and `backend.TestQuantizeOnTheRoundingBoundary`, whose input sits within
two ulps of the rounding boundaries: the old arithmetic moves 3235-4897 of its
65536 int8s on every backend, and the host's two divisions taken with the
drivers' own division move 1915-4897 on both Vulkan devices. The two quantize kernels' goldens in `lowertest` moved
and nothing else did.

After it block 0 reads 1.2e-08 against the host and 1.3e-08 between splits.

★ THE SECOND IS METAL'S ALONE, AND IT IS GRANITE'S ALONE. `kernels.AddScaled`
wrote `a + alpha*b` as a multiply and an add. ptxas and both Vulkan drivers
fuse that into one rounding, which is what the host's axpy does
(`VFMADD231PS`, `FMLA`); Metal's IEEE math does not, and its scaled residual
parted from the host's in the last bit of 2.8% of residual-like elements. At
alpha 1 the two forms agree, so no llama could see it. It is `ir.Fma` now, and
`backend.TestAddScaledRoundsOnce` holds it to the exact value rounded once
(math/big, since the arm64 Go compiler fuses an expression on its own): 1878 of
65536 differ on the M4 under the old kernel.

★ AND THE EXCESS AT THE LOGITS IS THE CONTROL. With both fixed, CUDA still
reads 2.9x. On the gate's prompt every pair among the host and the device at
splits 1, 2, 4 and 8, worst logit NMSE over the 17 compared steps:

                        host against the four    the device's six pairs
    3050 Ti CUDA        9.9e-03 .. 2.5e-02       8.4e-03 .. 2.3e-02
    3050 Ti SPIR-V      1.1e-02 .. 1.8e-02       4.3e-03 .. 3.1e-02
    Llama-3.2-1B CUDA   2.2e-03 .. 5.0e-03       1.7e-03 .. 4.5e-03

The host sits inside the device's own spread. The gate's control is one of the
six pairs, splits 1 and 4, and on SPIR-V it is the lowest of them, which is
the whole of its 3.2x; the 4.5x before the fix was the same pair, lowest then
too. Two more prompts read the host's pairs inside the device's or level with
its top (CUDA 3.8e-03..6.9e-03 against 3.1e-03..9.5e-03; SPIR-V
3.3e-03..2.7e-02 against 3.0e-03..2.2e-02). Means
over steps tell it more quietly: the host's pairs read 1.0-1.4x the device's on
this prompt and 0.9-1.0x on the other two.

What the host still does that no device pair does is its own reduction order
outside the matvec, and a single int8 flip from it is the kick: on
granite-4.0-micro block 0, CUDA and Vulkan agree with each other to 1e-13 and
both part from the host by 3e-05 to 8e-05 from position 7 on, where the host's
attention-norm row is 2 ulps from a float64 norm and quantizes one int8
differently from it. Granite's block-0 inputs carry amax 11-25 times their RMS
(Llama-3.2-1B's 7-20), so one quantum is a bigger share of the row. On CUDA a
second such flip comes from FlashDecodeKV's order (granite-3.3-2b position 12;
`StagedDecode` removes it). These are order differences of kinds the split
control does not vary; the seam says they enter at the same size as the
control's (block 0 at 1.2e-08 against 1.3e-08), and the table says where they
end.

Neither reference keeps any of this wider. llama.cpp's granite graph scales
the block output (`ggml_scale`, its own kernel, so rounded) and then adds it
(`ggml_add`): two roundings in f32. vLLM's `granite.py` writes `residual +
hidden_states * residual_multiplier` in the model's dtype, bf16 as served, and
gives Granite none of the fused add-and-norm its llama gets. jitllm's host and
devices round the scaled add once (FMA), which is a last-bit difference from
llama.cpp of the order kind, and the same on every tier now.

Refuted on the way: the residual add on CUDA and Vulkan (already fused, and
bit for bit the host's), the f16 KV cache (the gate opens with
`WithKVF16(false)`), the attention scale (1/64 is a power of two, exact in any
order), and the logit divisor (both arms divide, and dropping it reads 53).

So the dense band stays the dense gate's 8x of its control. 4x would fail on
the draw alone: on SPIR-V the host against split 4 is 4.2x the 1-against-4
pair. The mixture's host arm keeps 5e-2. A mixture's step, here and in
`TestStepAcrossSessionsEveryArchitecture` (`stepBound`), takes 8x its own
order control (`orderControl`) where that is wider than 5e-2 -- Qwen3-MoE's
stays at 5e-2 --
granite-3.1-1b-a400m's step on the M4 reads 8.4e-02 at row 9, where an order
change alone reads 1.4e-02 at the same row; over six prompt sets its step
reads 3.1e-03..8.4e-02 with the grouped experts in binary16 and
2.4e-03..6.8e-02 with them int8 (`NoVoltaMoE`), and 1.0e-02..4.9e-02 before
either fix, where Qwen3-MoE-4x0.6B's reads 4.6e-03..7.3e-03 on the same
harness. The tail is the model's router, not the tile path and not this
change. The step's own break (`ScaleFaultStepResidual`, 1.26-1.39 on the
mixture) must clear that band and ten times the clean step rather than ten
bands: the Iris Xe's control reads 1.8e-02, a band of 0.147, against a clean
step of 7.7e-03.

What it costs: the fused norm-and-quantize kernel, which every thread of a
1024-wide group runs the scales in, is 6.83 -> 7.56 us a launch on the 3050
Ti's CUDA and 8.2 -> 8.4 on its Vulkan (2048 wide, medians, base and fixed
alternated six times each), and `Quantize` is unchanged. Two of them a block
is ~0.3% of a Llama-3.2-1B decode token on that card (131 tok/s) by
arithmetic; not resolvable end to end here, the card being shared while it was
measured.

### The dense bound is the model's own order band

The dense step gate held Llama-3.2-1B to `mlaDeviceNMSE`, 1e-2, and the V100
read 6.95e-03. `model.TestStepNMSEBand` measured what that is, 8 sessions x
32 teacher-forced steps against each session alone on the device, beside two
references on the same tokens: the host, and the device decoding alone at a
pinned matvec split -- the same arithmetic summed in another order and nothing
else.

The step sits inside its model's order band everywhere, and the band is the
model's: Qwen3-4B's worst is eight times Llama's on the same card.
It does not grow with the step (steps 0-7, 8-15 and 16-31 read alike), with
the rows (two, three, four and eight sessions alike, the last on the tiled
twins), or with the depth (Llama 1B, 3B and 8B: 7.0e-03, 1.3e-03, 1.8e-03).
Decode's fusions apart (`NoRagFuse`) change nothing. gemma's step of up to
four sessions is decode bit for bit on CUDA; Llama's is not, so what differs
there is the ragged attention and decode's flash-decode kernel summing a row
in another order, which the split control prices.

So no constant fits: Qwen3-4B's step reads 2.3e-02 on CUDA and 4.7e-02 on
SPIR-V against a Llama step of 2e-03-7e-03, and a bound wide enough for the
first would pass a violation on the second. The dense gate measures its own
order-only control instead (`orderControl`: the three sessions alone at split
1 against split 4, on the same device in the same run) and holds the step to
`denseStepBand` = 8 times it, as `pagedBand` does for the paged history.
Over 37 (model, device) pairs the ratio step/control reads a geometric mean of
0.90, a worst of 2.44 (Qwen3-0.6B on the M4, Qwen2-VL on the Iris Xe) and a
log10 spread of 0.24; 4 would fail one 40-pair sweep in seven on noise, 8 one
in five hundred. The violations against it:

    "session" (rows read the current session's pages)  1.03-1.13   15-46x
    "nocap" (the per-row head uncapped)                 1.44-1.51   17-51x
    "swatab" (gemma3's local layers on the global table) 5.4e-02-8.3e-02  6.4-27x

Mixtures keep `mixtureStepNMSE` (5e-2): their grouped experts run int8 or
binary16 where decode runs one row, and a router near a tie widens the band
past an order change. Synthetic fixtures are held to `fixtureStepNMSE`
(1e-9), on which every clean step reads 0 to 2.9e-12 -- except a mixture
whose experts ran in binary16 (synth-gptoss's MXFP4 banks on Metal's tiles,
8.6e-04), which keeps the mixture bound.

## A launch past the device's workgroup limit

One `vkCmdDispatch` may ask for at most `maxComputeWorkGroupCount[0]`
workgroups along x, and every launch in this tree is one-dimensional. The
limits, read from `VkPhysicalDeviceLimits` and checked against vulkaninfo by
`vulkan.TestWorkGroupCountIsReadFromTheDriver`:

    vulkan:0  RTX 3050 Ti Laptop   2147483647
    vulkan:1  Iris Xe (ADL GT2)         65535   (the specification's floor)
    vulkan:2  llvmpipe                  65535
    cuda:0    gridDim.x            2147483647   (CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_MAX_GRID_DIM_X)
    Metal     no per-grid limit reported; 2^20 threadgroups ran whole on the M4

A Restride of a transposed K over 1024 rows at 8400 positions is 67200
workgroups of 128, past the Iris Xe's limit. The Vulkan backend handed that
count to `vkCmdDispatch` as it was.

**The Iris Xe ran it correctly anyway.** Unsplit, its Mesa driver wrote every
word right at 70000 workgroups of 256 and 1024 threads and at 2^23 workgroups of
one thread, so on the only device here with the small limit a buffer check
passes the old behaviour. It is still invalid usage, and the Khronos validation
layer says so for every such dispatch:

    VUID-vkCmdDispatch-groupCountX-00386: groupCountX (70000) exceeds device
    limit maxComputeWorkGroupCount[0] (65535)

What a driver does with it is its own business, so a launch is now split
(`vulkan.Ctx.dispatch`): pieces of at most the limit, each pushing the index of
its first workgroup as a 4-byte push constant, which `spirv.Emit` adds to
`WorkgroupId.x` to make the IR's CTAID. The pieces cover the launch exactly, so
no kernel sees a CTAID an unsplit launch would not give it and no surplus
workgroup exists to clamp -- which matters, because several kernels use
`CTAID()` with no clamp of their own (flash's merge takes it as the item
outright, the Volta GEMM divides a segment index out of it), so a 2-D grid with
a ragged last row would have written past their outputs. Every launch pushes the base, 0 when it fits, so every kernel runs the
one path; the cost is that every SPIR-V module carries the block and an add,
which moved every `lowertest` golden.

The gates: `backend.TestALaunchPastTheGroupLimitRunsWhole` (every CTAID and a
shared-memory neighbour across a barrier, both launch paths, every device, and
every Vulkan device again at a forced limit of 97), `TestRealKernelsPastTheGroupLimit`
(Restride past 65535 by itself; matvec with a Reduce, an in-group split and a
row tile at a forced limit of 7) and `TestSplitLaunchesAreValidVulkanUsage`
(both, under the validation layer). Against the old single dispatch the data
gates stay green on the Iris Xe -- the driver's tolerance above -- and fail on
the dispatch count, and the validation gate fails on the VUID. Against a
lowering that drops the base, every split launch writes the wrong workgroups.

The validation layer also reported the batch descriptor pool outliving its
device at every `Ctx.Close` (`VUID-vkDestroyDevice-device-05137`); `Close`
destroys it now.

CUDA and Metal refuse a launch past their limits by name instead of splitting:
their limits sit at or past the reach of the IR's 32-bit flat index, and a
split there would put a base on every PTX and MSL kernel for a launch nothing
can make.

## A hybrid's ragged step on a device with no 32-lane subgroup: the scan's one-thread form

A linear block's ragged step -- a batch's, a step across sessions, a
speculation's verification, a prompt chunk riding beside decoding rows -- runs
the delta rule as `kernels.GatedDeltaFused` with `Runs`, one launch for every
run. `prepRagLinear` refused it on any device that does not guarantee a 32-lane
subgroup ("a linear block's batched step needs a guaranteed 32-lane
subgroup"), and `nn.RowsLinear` / `State.rowsLinear` sent such a device's
hybrid one session at a time or down the prompt chunk. On this laptop that was
llvmpipe (subgroups of 8, no size control); a Vulkan driver that will not pin
the width is the same case. RULE 8 makes that a kernel to write, not a
decline.

The kernel was already written. `gatedDeltaScan` puts `ScanLanes()` lanes on a
state row and reduces both dots with shuffles across them; at `Lanes: 1` the
lane count is one, both butterflies are empty, the row lives in one thread's
registers and the dots sum serially -- no shuffle, no shared memory, so it
lowers on every backend. The chunk path has run that form on such devices all
along (`deltaScan` at `qkLanes == 1`); only the run form had never been built
at one lane. `prepRagLinear` now builds it at the device's lanes, and the
refusal, `nn.RowsLinear`, `GPU.RowsLinear` and `State.rowsLinear` are deleted.
The lane-group form stays wherever the subgroup is guaranteed.

`tier.Config.ScalarLinearRows` forces the one-thread form on a device that has
the subgroup, so the form is gated on real hardware, and
`Stats.LinearRowsScalar` counts the linear blocks a ragged step emitted on it:
the model gates' `checkLinearRowsForm` demands it non-zero where the device
guarantees no 32 lanes or the form was forced (`JITLLM_SCALAR_LINEAR_ROWS=1`
in the model tests), and zero elsewhere.

Kernel gate, `backend.TestRunsStepEachSequenceAlone`, now with one-lane cases
at key widths 7, 8, 12, 32, 48 and 128 and value widths 5, 9, 13, 24, 32 and
128, per-head and per-channel decay, tiled keys: each run form against each
sequence alone through the chunk kernels (bit for bit on ptx), and the
one-thread form against the lane groups on the same step:

    one thread against 4..32 lanes a row     output NMSE 9.4e-15 .. 6.5e-14
                                             state  NMSE 1.3e-15 .. 4.7e-15
    bound                                    1e-10

                                             each alone and against the lanes

only there).

the host's ids). The kernel gate reproduced it without a model:
`JITLLM_VK_DEVICE=2 go test ./jit/gpu/backend -run
TestMatVecSegmentsIsTheSeparateLaunches` faulted on its first spirv case.
spirv-val passed the module, the validation layer reported nothing, and the
fault was a load through a null base.

It is the driver, and the other backends were never reading anything wrong.
Bisected on the raw module (run through `vulkan.Ctx.Compile` with dummy
buffers, two Q8_0 segments of 64 rows):

    every workgroup runs its segment once (count forced to 1)    runs
    one workgroup, inside segment 0's run                        runs
    one workgroup, outside segment 1's run (count 0)             FAULTS
    segment 1 alone, its count a push constant that is 0         FAULTS
    the same, one buffer read and stored at the entry            runs
    the same, that access after the loops instead                FAULTS
    the same, an unused (or Volatile) load at the entry          FAULTS

So a workgroup faults when it runs a loop ZERO times and that loop holds the
module's first buffer access (with a loop nested in it: a GLSL version of the
shape faults with eight loads in the inner body and runs with two or four, so
what Mesa's optimiser makes of the nest decides it too). gdb names the mechanism: `bsf` on the execution mask, `cmovb`
to lane 0 when the mask is empty, then a load at `0x180`/`0x188` -- binding 6's
descriptor, base and size -- through lane 0 of a per-lane copy of the
descriptor set's base address, which is zero. Mesa's own comment on
`first_active_invocation` says gallivm runs code under an empty mask ("portions
of a loop after a break ... has ended the last invocation") and returns lane 0
then; upstream fixed the dereference in 63b89856, "gallivm: don't deref a NULL
buffer descriptor with an empty exec mask" (*"When no invocation is active,
first_active_invocation() selects lane 0, which can have a NULL SSBO descriptor
address"*), after this box's Mesa 25.2.8. MatVecSegments is the shape that
reaches it: every access of every segment sits in that segment's run loop,
which the other segments' workgroups run zero times.

**The fix is in the SPIR-V lowerer** (`spirv.anchorFor`): a module whose first
buffer access sits inside a loop with a runtime count reads one descriptor at
its entry, ahead of every loop, with `OpArrayLength` -- a descriptor read, not a
memory one -- and keeps it alive by passing that loop's count through a select
on a length no buffer can have (2^32-1 elements of 4 bytes). The base address
then has a definition that dominates every use. Of the lowertest corpus's 91
kernels only `matvecseg` qualifies, and it is the one golden that moved; PTX
and MSL are untouched. `spirv.TestDescriptorAnchor` pins the shape (and fails
against an emitter that skips it), and against that same violation the
llvmpipe kernel gate and the `jitllm run` reproducer fault again.

    llvmpipe, JITLLM_GPU_TUNE=0 JITLLM_GPU_SPLIT=2 JITLLM_GPU_FORCE_GROUP=1,
    Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M, 16 blocks placed, 24 tokens:

    TestDecodeDoesNotAllocate, JITLLM_STEP_DEVICES=vulkan:2, device tuner ON
      (the llvmpipe arm above was taken with it off because this faulted):
      0 engine allocations on every arm that ran -- Llama-3.2-1B decode with
      10 of 16 blocks placed (its step arms skip: llvmpipe's budget holds 10),
      olmoe decode, Qwen3.5-0.8B decode and all four step arms

## Every Vulkan device vanished partway through a V100 test process

On the V100 box, one `engine/model` process ran `vulkan:5` arms green until
`TestSchedulerOnDeviceLatent` or `TestStepRunsAdmitsALatentPrompt` had passed,
and then every later Vulkan arm skipped: *"vulkan: device 5 is out of range,
this host has 1: [0] llvmpipe"*. Nine skips in one run, main's binary too, and
every one of them read as green.

**Nothing leaked a handle and no device was lost.** File descriptors, threads
and mappings stayed flat across the run, and every `VkInstance` and `VkDevice`
was destroyed. The loader said what happened, once asked (`VK_LOADER_DEBUG=error`):

    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnvidia-tls.so.580.173.02: cannot allocate memory
    in static TLS block
    loader_icd_scan: Failed loading library associated with ICD JSON
    libGLX_nvidia.so.0. Ignoring this JSON

Every `OpenDevice` and every `List` created an instance and destroyed it, and
the loader dlopens each ICD at `vkCreateInstance` and dlcloses it with the last
instance. `libGLX_nvidia`, `libnvidia-glcore` and `libnvidia-tls` are all
`DF_STATIC_TLS`, and glibc serves a dlopened module's initial-exec TLS from a
fixed surplus that it did not get back here. So each instance spent some of it
until a load found none, and the loader enumerated the remaining ICDs
without an error. The surplus is the budget, which a tunable shows:

    TestReopeningKeepsEveryDevice, unfixed, V100 (glibc 2.39, driver 580.173.02)
    default surplus                                FAIL at cycle 10, 9 -> 1 devices
    GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.rtld.optional_static_tls=2048   FAIL at cycle 14

The laptop (driver 550.163.01, three devices) reloads the ICD just as often --
`LD_DEBUG=files` generates libnvidia-tls's link map 11 times in 5 cycles on
both hosts -- and kept all three devices over 1000 cycles, so whether a box
runs out depends on what else lands in the surplus. A gate that only ran there
would never have seen it.

**The fix is one `VkInstance` for the process** (`vulkan.instance`): created on
first use, never destroyed, shared by every `Ctx` and `List`. The ICD stays
loaded, and an open costs a logical device and no instance: 200 open/close
cycles take 14.3 s on the V100 where 10 took 96.5 s, and 4.0 s on the laptop
against 15.4 s. The loader's environment is now read once, at the first open,
so `TestSoftwareVulkanIsDeclined` narrows it to lavapipe in a child process.

**And the skip is loud now.** `enumerate` remembers the process's first device
count and returns `vulkan.ErrDevicesVanished` for an enumeration that comes
back shorter. `engine/model`'s device arms skip through `noDevice`, which fails
on that error; `engine/model`, `jit/gpu/backend` and `jit/gpu/tier` fail the
binary from `TestMain` when any enumeration shrank, for a skip `noDevice` does
not reach. Against the unfixed engine the latent sequence that had skipped
four Vulkan arms failed them ("was there earlier in this process and is gone
... enumerates 1 device(s) where this process first enumerated 9") and
`TestMain` printed FAIL.

The whole `engine/model` package in one process on a V100, `cuda:0` and the
card's own Vulkan index named in JITLLM_STEP_DEVICES, JITLLM_SPEC_DEVICES and
JITLLM_MIX_DEVICES:

    main's binary   0 Vulkan arms passed, 48 skipped "out of range" -- from
                    the first one, TestDecodeDoesNotAllocate's Llama-3.2-1B
                    arm, since the tests before it had spent the surplus
    this fix        78 Vulkan arms passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed, no enumeration
                    shrank

**The validation layer found a second, unrelated defect on the same path.**
Under `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` the latent gates reported
`VUID-vkDestroyDevice-device-05137` at every device close: twelve kernels per
tier on synth-deepseek, each a shader module, pipeline, two layouts and a
descriptor pool the device still owned. They were the expert banks' indexed
matvecs, which `mkkID` compiled per block and nothing closed --
`ReleaseLayers` leaves kernels to the device caches, and no cache held these.
They come from `devTier.idKernel` now, one per shape for the device, closed
with it. `vulkan.Ctx` keeps a ledger of what it compiled, closes what is still
open before the device and names it in `vulkan.Orphans`;
`TestClosingADeviceLeavesNoKernelOpen` fails on any orphan (12 and 8 against
the per-block compile) and the same run under the layer reports no VUID.

## One shared Vulkan command buffer broke every hybrid (found on Kimi-Linear)

★★★★★ **AND THE HYBRID PATH ON VULKAN IS FIXED: KIMI-LINEAR RUNS 3 OF 3
BLOCKS ON spirv AT worst logit NMSE 7.073e-12, BESIDE CUDA's 4.993e-12.** The
bug was older than Kimi Delta Attention and broke every hybrid on that
backend, and it was ONE SHARED COMMAND BUFFER.

`Ctx` held a single `cmd`, and three things used it: the recorded `Batch`, the
one-shot `Kernel.Launch`, and `copyBuf`. Both one-shots begin with
`vkResetCommandBuffer` and end with `vkEndCommandBuffer` -- so a copy issued
WHILE a batch was recording reset the buffer the batch was recording into, and
every dispatch encoded after it went to a command buffer that was no longer in
the recording state. **Vulkan drops those silently.** CUDA has no equivalent:
its launches go to a stream.

★ **AND ONLY A HYBRID EVER TRIGGERED IT, WHICH IS WHY IT SURVIVED SO LONG.**
`emitLinear` is the one path in this tree that writes a buffer from INSIDE a
recorded session -- `s.Write(bs.dRows, ...)`, the row count `Conv1dShift`
reads -- and a device-local write stages through `copyBuf`. Every dispatch
after the FIRST linear block was therefore discarded, including the whole head
sequence, which is why the logits came back exactly zero and why keeping the
head on the host "fixed" it.

`Ctx.one` is a second command buffer for the one-shots. The batch keeps `cmd`.

★★★ **AND WHAT FOUND IT WAS THE VALIDATION LAYER, AFTER SIX KERNEL FAMILIES,
GRAPH CAPTURE, PARTIAL ROTARY, THE OUT-GATE, THE k-SPLIT, THE VOCABULARY, TWO
BARRIER HAZARDS AND AN FFI KEEP-ALIVE HAD ALL BEEN ELIMINATED BY MEASUREMENT
AND NONE OF THEM WAS IT.** `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation` is not installed on
this box; RULE 11 says fetch it rather than record the absence, and
`apt-get download` plus `dpkg-deb -x` needs no root. It named the fault on the
first run:

    VUID-vkCmdDispatch-commandBuffer-recording:
    vkCmdDispatch() was called before vkBeginCommandBuffer()

**Three sessions of eliminations against one run of the tool that checks the
API contract.** The lesson is not that the eliminations were wasted -- they
are what made the reading unambiguous -- it is that a backend with a
conformance checker should have had it pointed at this the first time a whole
model came back wrong. It reports ZERO errors now.

★ **THE GATE THAT LET IT HIDE IS FIXED TOO, AND IT IS RULE 11d EXACTLY.** Every
hybrid device gate asked for `"gpu"`, which resolves to CUDA on every machine
this project has, so the gated delta rule had never executed on SPIR-V at all.
`TestHybridAttentionBlockOnDevice` sweeps cuda, vulkan and metal now -- 8 pass,
4 skip for the absent backend.

★ **AND THE THREE HARDENINGS FOUND ON THE WAY STAY, LABELLED AS WHAT THEY
ARE.** The dispatch barrier now covers read -> write and write -> write as
well as write -> read, and `runtime.KeepAlive` guards the descriptor `infos`
in both `Kernel.Bind` and `Batch.Encode`, where a `uintptr` had been the only
reference across the FFI call. All three are real defects and NONE of them was
this one.

★ **AND THREE THINGS MATCHED BEFORE THE BUG WAS FOUND, WHICH IS WHAT MADE THE
NARROWING FAST**: the pre-conv projections (so the q|k|v fuse order is right),
the post-conv q/k/v at both positions (so the convolution and its state are
right), and the decay and beta to every printed digit (so the low-rank forget
gate, the `-exp(A_log)` broadcast and the per-channel axis are right). gpt-oss runs on the host and on every device
backend (`TestSynthGPTOSSOnEveryDevice`);
`docs/engineering-history/model-correctness.md` has how the host was verified
and `gpu-kernels.md` ("MXFP4 and float weights run on the device, and the tier
never told it a block had sinks") the device.

## RULE 11c's cases: the tier's wiring of gated kernels

### ★ RULE 11c: THE KERNELS ARE GATED. THE TIER'S WIRING OF THEM IS NOT.

**A new graph feature is not on the device until an end-to-end gate runs a
model that HAS it, every block placed, against the host.** gpt-oss's sinks and
mixture biases were gated kernel by kernel and never reached a block: the
offered plan did not carry them (`docs/engineering-history/gpu-kernels.md`,
"MXFP4 and float weights run on the device"). The cases below are the same shape.

**Two architectures were producing wrong text on the GPU and every kernel gate
was green**, because a gate on `kernels.MatVec` proves the KERNEL and says
nothing about whether the tier asked for the right one. Found together, both
pre-existing, both silent:

    qwen2  CUDA  [785 6722 315 9625 374 99789 16935 10251 107289 151643 ... 6484 6484]
    phi3   CUDA  [450 7483 310 3444 338 341 264 264 264 264 264 264 264 264 264]

★ **THE BIAS FLAG WAS DROPPED FOR EVERY DENSE MATVEC.** `mkkID` takes a `bias`
argument and, for `experts <= 1` -- which is every weight of every non-MoE model
-- called `mkk`, which built the kernel with no `Bias` at all. `batchMVDot4`
never set it either. **Only the EXPERT path and the MMA twin ever did.** So a
6-buffer kernel was launched with 7 buffers: Vulkan refuses by name ("kernel
wants 6 buffers, got 7") and declines the block, and **CUDA does not check
arity at all** -- it ignores the extra pointer and the bias is simply never
added. And `kernKey` had no bias field, so even once passed, a biased matvec
could collide with an unbiased one of the same shape.

★ **AND A ROW RANGE OF A PACKED TENSOR WAS UPLOADED WHOLE.** `model.rows()`
split phi3's fused `attn_qkv` and its fused gate/up -- and for a PACKED weight it
cannot slice bytes, because the device layout is `[sub-block][word][row]` and
rows are interleaved, so it carried the offset in `Packed.Row`/`Stride`, which
`nn.MatVecPacked` honours. `devTier.resident` uploads `QS`/`D`/`SC` whole and
reads NEITHER field, and `MatVecShape` has nowhere to put them -- so k and v
were the same buffer as q, indexed from row 0.

★★ **AND DECLINING IT WAS THE WRONG SHAPE OF ANSWER, WHICH IS WORTH KEEPING.**
The first fix made the tier decline the block: correct output, phi3 on the host.
That reads as a missing capability, and it was not one -- **phi3's fused qkv is a
PACKING CHOICE OF THE FILE.** GGUF is the converter's input, so it dies at
conversion, exactly as the mmproj's two-file contract does.

★ **AND `attn_qkv` DOES NOT MEAN THE SAME THING IN EVERY ARCHITECTURE, WHICH
NEARLY COST A WRONG CONTAINER.** qwen3next names the LINEAR block's fused q/k/v
`attn_qkv` too, and there the fusion is the GRAPH rather than the file: the delta
rule consumes one mixed projection of 8192 rows on a geometry `deltaGeom` owns,
not `NHead*HeadDim + 2*NKVHead*HeadDim`. Unfusing it by the attention shape would
have written three wrong tensors. It did not, because the row check refused --
*"blk.0.attn_qkv.weight has 8192 rows, and its parts want 5120"* -- and no
container was written. `unfuse` is gated on `Arch == ArchPhi3` now and the row
check stays as the backstop. **The rule is narrower than "a fused weight is a
file artifact": it is true of phi3 and false of qwen3next.** `convert.unfuse`
splits both fused weights while the bytes are still GGUF row-major, where a row
range IS a byte range: three slices and no arithmetic. `FlagFusedQKV` and
`FlagFusedGateUp` are RETIRED -- the bits stay reserved rather than reused,
because a value that changes meaning between versions is what the version number
exists to prevent -- and `model`'s splitting paths are deleted.

**Phi-3.5-mini: 27 blocks placed, token ids identical to the host.** 197 tensors
become 293, the same bytes addressed separately, page size and padding unchanged.

`devTier.declineWeights` stays as RULE 8a insurance for any future weight that
arrives with a row offset, and is unreachable for every shipped model.

**Why nothing saw either.** `backend/matvec_test.go` tests `Bias: withBias` and
passes -- the kernel was always right. `model.TestAttentionBiasesReachTheModel`
is a HOST-path injection test that says so in its own comment ("it needs no
biased model, which is the whole point"). **No Go gate compares a real device
against the host for a text model**; that only lives in `scripts/three-way.sh`,
which runs tinyllama -- a model with no biases and no fused qkv.

**So a device gate must run a model that HAS the feature, end to end, against
the host.** A kernel gate and a host gate can both be green while the tier wires
them together wrongly, and that is the shape to look for, not an exception.

★ **AND CPU-vs-DEVICE TOKEN EQUALITY IS NOT THE BAR; COHERENCE IS.** After the
fix qwen2 on CUDA still parts from the CPU at token 6 and stays coherent, which
is the f32 reduction-order band RULE 12 already records (0.2-0.94 of a logit).
Run-to-run it is the SPLIT TUNER: `tuneSplit` times kernels at load, so the
split -- and the reduction order with it -- varies per process. `JITLLM_GPU_TUNE=0`
makes three runs identical. Pin it before comparing anything.

★★★ **AND THE SIZE OF THAT BAND IS A FUNCTION OF HOW MANY BLOCKS RUN BELOW THE
SEAM, WHICH IS MEASURED AND IS 2550x ON A HYBRID. AN ABSOLUTE LOGIT DIFFERENCE
ACROSS A DEEP SEAM IS NOT EVIDENCE OF A DEVICE BUG.** The SAME block of the same
48-block hybrid, moved only in DEPTH
(`model.TestHybridDeviceErrorIsAmplification`):

    one device block at block 43, 4 host blocks below    logit NMSE 7.769e-06
    one device block at block 3, 44 host blocks below    logit NMSE 1.981e-02

1.21x per block, and it is the compounding `TestTowerOnDeviceMatchesHost`
already records from the other side ("5e-6 after one block is 1e-3 after
twelve") travelling a recurrence. Qwen3-Next-80B with one block at index 3 of 48
therefore reads `max|dlogit|` 1.0-3.5 at EVERY position INCLUDING 0 -- where
attention is a softmax over one key and the block's output is exactly V[0], so
no cache, rope or score kernel can be involved -- and that is not a fault.
**The falsifiable form is to move the seam and see whether the error tracks the
depth below it**, which is one test and a quarter of a second; reading the
absolute number instead cost most of a session. See
`docs/engineering-history/placement.md` 15i.

★ **A DENSE MODEL CAN BE THAT SENSITIVE TOO, AND THE SECOND HALF OF THE TEST IS
AN INDEPENDENT ENGINE.** The post-norm checkpoints (OLMo 2, EXAONE 4) read
1.4-2.0 device-vs-host, and one block alone reads 1.33 at block 0 and 0.075 at
the last -- while llama.cpp's own CUDA build reads 1.16-1.93 from its CPU build
on the same file, and jitllm's host reads 0.85-3.35 from itself with only the V
cache's width changed. `model.TestPostNormDeviceErrorIsAmplification` holds
all three; `docs/engineering-history/model-correctness.md` has the table.

## The decode row tile on the device, spread rows: a regression on both backends

★★ **THE DECODE ROW TILE ON THE DEVICE -- TRIED AND MEASURED, A REGRESSION ON
BOTH BACKENDS, AND THE REASON GENERALISES.** The idea is the user's and it is the
right question: the HOST tier runs sixteen rows in one register file
(PackedFusedGroup) and the device ran ONE row per thread, because
`kernels.MatVec` refused `Rowt > 1` at `NTok <= 1`. That refusal was a guard and
not a limit -- the kernel body is already general in Rowt -- so it was lifted,
gated (`backend.TestMatVecMatchesReference/.../rowtN`, which reads NMSE 4.3e-01
against a tile that strides by 1 instead of Rows/Rowt) and measured. gemma-2b,
decode, `JITLLM_GPU_SPLIT=1` because the tile needs it:

| rows per thread | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M4 Metal tok/s | **49.41 / 49.44** | 36.96 | 21.05 | 9.36 |
| RTX 3050 Ti tok/s | **59.13** | 57.16 | 36.34 | -- |

Time grows roughly IN PROPORTION to the tile. **A decode matvec is THREAD-STARVED
on a GPU, not latency-starved**, which is the opposite of the host's problem and
why the same lever points the other way: six cores want register reuse, and a GPU
with tens of thousands of lanes wants more threads. Tiling rows divides the grid
by Rowt -- gemma's widest per-layer matvec is 16384 rows, which is 2048 threads
at Rowt=8. `Split` spends threads the other way, on k, and that is the axis that
pays here.

The knob survives as `tier.Config.DecodeRowt` (`JITLLM_GPU_ROWT`), default off,
with `Stats.RowtTiles`/`RowtPlain` beside it -- because the first three runs of
this experiment measured NOTHING and looked exactly like a null result: the tile
needs `Split == 1` and `tuneSplit` chooses the split first, so the knob reached
zero of 126 matvecs. **"It made no difference" and "it never ran" are the same
number without a counter.** RULE 10, caught by the counter rather than by care.

## Closed: the three-way proof's 1-in-30 failure was the unpinned split tuner

- ~~THE THREE-WAY PROOF FAILS ABOUT 1 RUN IN 30, AND IT IS UNATTRIBUTED~~
  **ATTRIBUTED AND CLOSED, WITH A DETERMINISTIC REPRODUCER. IT WAS
  THE GATE, NOT THE ENGINE.**

  `scripts/three-way.sh` asserts TOKEN-ID EQUALITY against a host run and did
  NOT pin the split tuner. `tuneSplit` measures at load, so the split -- and the
  f32 reduction order with it -- varies PER PROCESS. The entry on CPU-vs-device
  equality in RULE 11c already said the words: *"Run-to-run it is the SPLIT
  TUNER... `JITLLM_GPU_TUNE=0` makes three runs identical. Pin it before
  comparing anything."* The script never did, so it was asserting bit-stability
  across a knob that legitimately moves, and it failed whenever the tuner
  happened to land on a split that flipped a knife-edge argmax.

  **The reproducer, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct Q4_K_M on cuda:0, SHIPPED path, one
  process per split:**

      split  1  2  4      correct
      split  8  16        DEGENERATE REPETITION -- it replays an earlier span
      split 32            correct

  Deterministic at every width, which is what says it is not a race. And
  `jitllm verify` names the mechanism at the flip: **"pos 5: cpu 35490 (margin
  0.00167)"** -- a 0.0017-logit margin, far inside the 0.2-0.94 reduction-order
  band this file already documents. The argmax there is a coin toss and greedy
  decoding amplifies it into the repetition, which is why the SYMPTOM looked
  like a KV-cache corruption and the CAUSE is arithmetic reassociation.

  ★ **THE OLD HYPOTHESIS IS REFUTED, AND BY A MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN AN
  ARGUMENT.** It read *"the next hypothesis is the KV cache at a device
  boundary"*. There is no boundary: the failing configuration places **16 of 16
  blocks** on the Iris Xe, full offload, one device. Two more were refuted the
  same afternoon -- the captured graph (`JITLLM_GPU_GRAPH=0` makes it MORE
  frequent, 6/10 against 3/10) and the subgroup softmax (scalar 2/10 against
  warp 3/10). None of the three was the variable; the tuner was.

  ★ **AND ONLY ONE MODEL ON THE BOX SHOWS IT**, which is why it took so long:
  tinyllama and gemma-2b are identical at splits 1, 8 and 16. It needs a margin
  of 0.0017 to surface, and most prompts on most models do not have one.

  `three-way.sh` exports `JITLLM_GPU_TUNE=0` now. 4/4 clean, and 4/4 with the
  in-group reduction FORCED on (`JITLLM_GPU_FORCE_GROUP=1`), where the unpinned
  script had been failing 2/4.

  ★ **THE STANDING LESSON IS NARROWER THAN "PIN THE TUNER".** An equality gate
  must pin every knob its equality depends on, and a gate that fails 1 run in 30
  is not flaky -- it is measuring something it did not mean to hold still.

## Metal decode against the oracles: where the token goes

- **★ METAL'S MATRIX UNITS ARE AVAILABLE AND UNREACHABLE, AND THE COMMENT THAT
  REFUSES THEM IS HALF RIGHT.** `msl.go` declines `ir.OpMMA` outright: *"MSL's
  simdgroup_matrix is float only -- half and float, no int8 -- so there is no
  integer matrix instruction to lower to at all."* True of `MMAS8`, which is the
  quantized matvec. **False of the case that matters**: `kernels.AttnScoresMMA`
  asks for `ir.MMAF16` -- binary16 x binary16 -> float32 -- and an M4 probe
  reports `simdgroup_float8x8 multiply_accumulate` and `simdgroup_half8x8`
  **AVAILABLE**. So attention on Metal falls through to the FMA tile while the
  hardware's matrix unit sits idle, and the refusal reads as a hardware fact
  rather than the missing lowering it is.

  ★ **AND THE BLOCKER IS A SHAPE MISMATCH, NOT A MISSING SWITCH CASE.** The IR's
  MMA is PTX-shaped -- `MMAShape{M:16,N:8,K:16}` with per-lane FRAGMENTS from
  `sh.Frags()` -- and Metal's `simdgroup_matrix` is an opaque 8x8 tile with
  load/store/multiply_accumulate and no documented lane layout. Mapping
  fragments onto it would depend on an undocumented and unguaranteed internal
  order. The sound route is a TILE-shaped MMA op the IR can express and Metal
  can lower natively, with the attention kernel choosing between the two -- a
  design decision, not a patch.

  **What Metal DOES do, measured on an M4 (16 GB, 4P+6E), decode:**

  | model | weights | host | metal | metal GB/s | |

  | gemma-2b Q4_0 | 1744 MiB | 29 | 45 | 83.0 | 1.55x |

  Every block is placed in every row, so this is not a placement failure.

  ★★ **AND METAL LOSES BELOW ~200 MiB BECAUSE A THIRD OF THE TOKEN IS FIXED
  SESSION COST.** `TestDeviceDecodeRate` with `JITLLM_SWEEP=1` moves the layer
  limit and prices the two terms apart, which a single full-offload number
  cannot do -- tinyllama, 22 layers:

      layers on card    0      1      2      4      8     11     22
      ms/token       18.31  18.40  18.18  17.90  15.26  14.34   8.65

  The first FOUR device layers save 0.4 ms where four host layers cost 3.3.
  Fitting `token = S + nDev*d + nHost*h` gives **h = 0.83 ms, d = 0.26 ms and
  S = 2.9 ms** -- 34% of an 8.65 ms token, paid once per contiguous device run.
  `backend/metal.go` already reduced this from one command buffer per LAUNCH to
  one per SESSION (288.8 us per dispatch against CUDA's 19.3, ~254 launches a
  token); what is left is the commit-and-wait itself. The "Metal indirect
  command buffer" entry on the shelved-levers list was shelved at "a 3% ceiling" --
  **that estimate is wrong by an order of magnitude** and the row above is why.

  ★★★ **AND AGAINST THE ORACLES jitllm LOSES ON METAL, ON FIVE OF SIX MODELS.
  THE M4 BOARD ABOVE IS PRE-CONTAINER AND ITS ROWS ARE NOW WRONG.** The user
  said so and the measurement agrees. llama.cpp b10985 (prebuilt macOS arm64,
  `llama-bench -p 0 -n 32 -r 3`) against `TestDeviceDecodeRate` on the same box
  and the same GGUFs:

  | model | llama.cpp | jitllm | ratio |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | tinyllama q3_K_M | 114.66 | 116.31 | 1.01 |
  | Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K | 112.61 | 92.05 | **0.82** |
  | gemma-2b | 56.57 | 45.38 | **0.80** (was 0.9509 pre-container) |
  | Qwen3-MoE-4x0.6B | 133.80 | 95.84 | **0.72** |
  | SmolVLM-256M Q8_0 | 335.06 | 260.53 | **0.78** |
  | stories15M q8_0 | 1268.50 | 731.36 | **0.58** |

  And MLX, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct 4-bit, 128 tokens: **131.4 / 131.9 tok/s**
  against jitllm's 92.05 -- **0.70x**. (MLX's 4-bit is its own group quant, not
  Q4_K_M, so that row is indicative; the llama.cpp rows are the same file.)
  These are two harnesses in two passes, NOT a RULE 2 row -- but 0.58-0.82 is
  far outside harness noise and the direction is not in doubt.

  ★★ **AND THE MATRIX UNITS ARE NOT THE GAP, WHICH THE ORACLE SETTLES.**
  llama.cpp prints `tensor API disabled for pre-M5 and pre-A19 devices` on this
  M4 -- it wins **without** simdgroup_matrix. So the MMA item above is a real
  absence and NOT the reason for these rows, and building it first would be
  optimising the wrong term.

  **The submission cost is the whole gap, and the arithmetic closes.** At
  S = 2.9 ms on tinyllama's 22 layers, removing it takes 8.65 ms/token to 5.75
  -- **174 tok/s against llama.cpp's 114.66**, a 1.5x win rather than parity.
  On Llama-3.2-1B the same subtraction gives ~126 against 112.61 and lands
  beside MLX's 131.7. jitllm already has shared buffers
  (`newBufferWithBytesNoCopy`, metal_darwin.go) and does NOT have residency
  sets, which llama.cpp announces as `use residency sets = true`; and
  `mtlSession.finish` ends in `waitUntilCompleted`, which is the blocking commit
  the 2.9 ms is made of.

  ★★ **AND MLX'S EDGE IS THREE THINGS, READ OUT OF ITS SOURCE, NONE OF THEM A
  KERNEL.** Cloned and compared on the user's suggestion:

  | | MLX | jitllm |
  |---|---|---|
  | after commit | makes the NEXT buffer and returns | `waitUntilCompleted` |
  | command buffer | `commandBufferWithUnretainedReferences` | `commandBuffer` |
  | residency | `MTL::ResidencySet`, standing `requestResidency()`, size-capped | none |
  | flush policy | `max_ops_per_buffer_ = 20` or an MB cap | one per caller Session |

  ★★★ **AND ITEM 1 BELOW WAS MEASURED AND IS WRONG ABOUT THE SIZE. SUBMISSION IS
  12% OF A METAL TOKEN, NOT 34%.** The async commit was BUILT (`Ctx.Wait`,
  `Batch.Commit` no longer blocks) and then instrumented, which is the only
  reason the error is visible:

      commits per token                 1.0     (batching was already right)
      Wait calls per token              ~6, of which ONE blocks
      encode                            0.034 ms/token over 89 dispatches
      blocked in waitUntilCompleted     1.35 ms/token
      wall inside backend Session       1.06 ms/token  <- bounds submission
      the token                         8.6 ms

  One command buffer per token and one blocking wait per token is what an
  autoregressive decode REQUIRES -- the next token cannot be encoded before this
  one's logits exist -- so there was never 2.9 ms of submission to remove. The
  earlier fit found a real fixed term and attributed it to the wrong mechanism:
  `S + nDev*d + nHost*h` has no term for "the GPU is slower per layer than the
  fit assumed", so that cost landed in S. **A model with three free parameters
  and seven points will name whatever you ask it to name.**

  ★★★ **AND SUBMISSION HAS A 3% CEILING, MEASURED BY THE TOOL BUILT TO MEASURE
  IT.** `jitllm verify -devices metal` on the M4, which prints exactly this:

      9.72 ms per token in Layers
      0.32 ms per token encoding launches (3% of Layers) -- the ceiling on a
        recording
      0 launch-sequence captures

  `verify.go`'s own comment says *"an indirect command buffer would encode once
  and replay, so this number is the ceiling on that change -- quote it before
  building one."* It was there the whole time and both of my submission
  estimates were made without reading it. **The shelved-levers list's "3% ceiling" for
  the Metal indirect command buffer was RIGHT, and the entry above calling it
  "wrong by an order of magnitude" was itself wrong.** Metal decode is GPU-BOUND.

  ★★ **AND MLX IS NOT FASTER PER BYTE THAN llama.cpp; IT READS FEWER BYTES.**
  Llama-3.2-1B: MLX's 4-bit group quant is ~0.70 GB at 131.7 tok/s = **92 GB/s**;
  llama.cpp's Q4_K_M is 0.81 GB at 112.61 = **91 GB/s**. The same rate. MLX's
  1.35x is its QUANTIZATION, not its kernels, and a row comparing the two
  without saying so compares two different models. jitllm is at ~84 GB/s on the
  same file -- a real ~8% kernel deficit, and much smaller than the 0.70x row
  suggests.

  ★★★ **THE M4's READ WALL IS 105.7 GB/s, MEASURED, AND EVERY EARLIER "% OF
  120" IN THIS ENTRY WAS AGAINST A SPEC SHEET.** MLX summing a contiguous 1 GiB
  float32 array, ten passes: **105.7 GB/s**. A neutral third party on the same
  box, and the same access pattern a matvec has. Against it:

      llama.cpp  Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M   112.61 tok/s x 0.808 GB =  91.0 GB/s   **86%**
      jitllm     same file              99.40 tok/s x 0.816 GB =  81.1 GB/s   **77%**

  So the gap is NINE POINTS OF WALL EFFICIENCY on a memory-bound kernel, not
  bytes and not submission -- and it is the whole of the 0.88 ratio.

  ★★★ **AND THE PER-FORMAT "28% PER-BYTE GAP" IS AN ARTIFACT OF CACHE
  RESIDENCY, RE-MEASURED ON A QUIET M4 AND REPRODUCIBLE TO 1 GB/s.**
  At ONE SHAPE (32768x2048) the six formats appeared to split into two camps --
  `Q3_K 100  Q4_0 99  Q4_K 99 | Q5_K 75  Q8_0 73  Q6_K 71` -- and a whole goal
  was written on it. But a 4-bit payload is HALF an 8-bit one, so at one shape
  the two camps sit at different points on the cache hierarchy and the faster
  row is simply the one that FITS. At 384 MiB EACH (`mvbench -eqbytes 384`),
  three runs:

    | | Q4_0 | Q4_K | Q3_K | Q8_0 | Q6_K | Q5_K |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | run 1 | 96 | 99 | 99 | 96 | 97 | 97 |
    | run 2 | 95 | 99 | 98 | 97 | 97 | 97 |
    | run 3 | 96 | 99 | 98 | 97 | 97 | 98 |

  **All six read 95-99 GB/s and the SLOWEST is Q4_0, a 4-bit format.** There is
  no per-byte penalty on the 8-bit or two-plane payloads. The remaining M4
  deficit is BYTES (Q3_K +34.5%; Q5_K was +56.8% when this was written and is
  **+2.3%** since container v15) and the nine points of wall efficiency above --
  not this.

  ★★ **AND THE TELL WAS PRINTED THE WHOLE TIME -- THE ROWS READ 103-110% OF THE
  WALL -- BUT THE DIVISOR IS NOT MERELY TOO SMALL. IT MEASURES THE PROBE.**
  `streamWall`'s answer is a function of its own working set, swept on a quiet
  M4:

      64 MiB 71.2 | 128 83.4 | **256 90.0** | 512 76.1 | 1024 67.2 | 2048 60.9 GB/s

  **It PEAKS at 256 MiB and falls away on both sides**, which no memory wall
  does. Rising to the peak is fixed overhead amortising; falling past it is the
  probe's own pattern -- it grid-strides at a 1 MiB stride with a FIXED thread
  count, so a bigger working set means each thread walks more distinct pages.
  Against MLX's 105.7 GB/s over a contiguous 1 GiB sum on the same box, every
  point on that curve is low, and the matvec rows sit at a stable 96-99 GB/s
  across all of them -- 91-94% of the MLX figure, which is where a saturated
  memory-bound kernel belongs.

  **So the ROWS are reproducible and the WALL is not, and no "% of wall" from
  this tool is quotable until the probe's access pattern is fixed.** Its comment
  claims "same access shape as the matvec"; a matvec that beats it by 7-9 points
  says otherwise. `-wallmib` makes the working set explicit so this is
  measurable rather than assumed.

  ★★★ **AND MY OWN FIX FOR IT WAS A GUESS, COMMITTED BEFORE IT WAS MEASURED,
  AND IT MADE THINGS WORSE.** The reasoning was "a probe over a smaller working
  set under-reads, so match the rows at 1 GiB". That took the divisor DOWN 28%
  and the percentages from 106% to **152%**. The hypothesis being wrong is
  ordinary; shipping it to the Mac and writing "the probe streams 1 GiB now" in
  a commit message before running it is not, and it is the same failure this
  file spends pages on one level up -- a number reported before it was measured.
  RULE 1's "above the roofline is a harness bug" found the bug for the second
  time here (the first was Metal's `Sync` returning before the GPU started, at
  106794% of wall); it did not license the first guess at a cure.

  ★ **THE OTHER HALF OF THE TOOL IS STILL BIASED AND IS NOT FIXED: the
  per-format headline is a MAX OVER SIX SPLIT VALUES**, which drifts upward with
  the noise. On the same-shape rows it shows plainly -- Q3_K read 98, 60, 98
  across three identical runs on a quiet box. The `-eqbytes` rows above do not
  show it because they are flat across splits (93 96 94 91 86 76), which is why
  they reproduce to 1 GB/s and the same-shape ones do not. Quote `-eqbytes`.

  ★★★ **RE-CONFIRMED, TWO BACK-TO-BACK RUNS ON A QUIET M4, AND THE
  SAME-SHAPE ROW FOR THE FORMAT THE OLD GOAL NAMED SWUNG 95 -> 71.** This is the
  sharpest available statement of the bias, because 71 is exactly the number a
  standing goal was written on ("Q8_0, Q5_K, Q6_K at 71-75 GB/s against 99-100
  for the 4-bit ones"):

    | row | run 1 | run 2 |
    |---|---|---|
    | `tll lm_head Q6_K` (same shape) | **95** | **71** |
    | `tll q/o Q4_K` (same shape) | 84 | 75 |
    | `tll ffn_down Q4_K` (same shape) | 75 | 57 |
    | eq/Q4_0 | 97 | 95 |
    | eq/Q8_0 | **97** | **97** |
    | eq/Q4_K | 99 | 98 |
    | eq/Q6_K | **98** | **98** |
    | eq/Q3_K | 99 | 99 |
    | eq/Q5_K | **96** | **97** |

  **The six equal-byte rows span 95-99 and reproduce to 1-2 GB/s; the
  same-shape rows for the same formats swing by up to 24 points between
  consecutive runs.** Q4_0 -- a 4-bit format -- is the SLOWEST of the six. So
  the "28% per-byte gap on the 8-bit and two-plane payloads" does not exist on
  Metal, and the goal built on it was aimed at one sample of an unstable row.
  **The Metal deficit is the nine points of WALL EFFICIENCY above, which is not
  per-format.** Note the rows read 104-109% of wall, which is the probe
  measuring itself (see two entries up) -- the rows are comparable to EACH OTHER
  and no "% of wall" from this tool is quotable.

  ★★★★ **AND THE ADJACENT-ROW TILE THAT FOLLOWED FROM ALL THIS IS A 7%
  REGRESSION, AS MEASURED. THE CONTIGUITY FINDING IS REAL AND DOES NOT
  TRANSFER TO THE MATVEC.** `TestDeviceDecodeRate`, Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M, Metal,
  16 of 16 blocks placed, one process per sample, ABBA, A/A self-control FIRST,
  on an idle M4:

    | | ratio | IQR/median | n | |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | **A/A (rowt 1 in BOTH arms)** | **1.0020** | **0.0035** | 8 | gates |
    | pass 1  rowt4 / rowt1 | **0.9264** | 0.047 | 8 | gates |
    | pass 2  rowt4 / rowt1 | **0.9329** | 0.043 | 8 | gates |

    rowt1  104.27 tok/s = 85.1 GB/s = **78% of the 108.9 GB/s wall**
    rowt4   96.97 tok/s = 79.1 GB/s = **73%**

  Two passes agreeing to 0.65 points behind a 0.2% harness bias. **The
  configuration WAS selected** -- the counters read `224 tiled (224 of them WITH
  a split), 0 plain` against the control's `0 tiled, 224 plain`, which is what
  `Stats.RowtSplitTiles` exists for.

  ★ **SO THE PROBE AND THE KERNEL DISAGREE, AND THAT IS THE FINDING RATHER THAN
  A DISAPPOINTMENT.** `StreamWide` is reproducible to 1%: a pure read gains 1.6x
  going from 4 B to 32 B per lane, and a strided arm with the SAME request count
  gains nothing, so contiguity is genuinely what a streaming read wants. A Q4_K
  matvec does not want it, because it is not load-latency-bound in the way the
  probe is -- it unpacks nibbles, rebuilds a scale from an f16 and a 6-bit
  integer and centres, and that arithmetic already hides the load. **The
  remaining eight points are therefore NOT in the load shape**, which is a real
  narrowing: it eliminates the one mechanism that a same-bytes same-grid probe
  could demonstrate.

  ★ **AND THE TILE COSTS DISPERSION, WHICH IS ITS OWN SIGNAL.** The rowt1 arm
  spreads 1.9% across sixteen samples and the rowt4 arm **11.0%**, and the
  selection check shows why: the split tuner chose 224 tiles in one pass and 192
  in the other, from the same binary on the same model. A tile makes the kernel
  far more sensitive to a per-process choice that AGENTS.md already prices at
  0.85 points.

  ★★ **WHAT SURVIVES AND MUST NOT BE LOST WITH IT.** The branch also fixes a
  LIVE CORRECTNESS BUG that has nothing to do with the tile and should land on
  its own terms: **Q5_K on the MMA path threw its fifth bit away**, so CUDA
  prefill decoded five-bit weights as four-bit for every Q5_K tensor since v15.
  `backend.TestMatVecMMAMatchesDot4` was RED for it (`1024/1024 elements differ,
  worst |delta| 1563.26`) and had been. It is the THIRD plane change to reach
  `matvec.go` and not `mma.go`, so the fix derives the lane's element group from
  the format's arithmetic instead of adding a third `case`, and refuses by name
  a shape where that index is not constant over the lane.

  ★ **AND "the decode row tile is a regression" IS NOW TRUE FOR TWO DIFFERENT
  REASONS, WHICH IS WORTH KEEPING SEPARATE.** The earlier decode-row-tile entry
  (under "Tried or priced, and each came out a REGRESSION") measured a SPREAD
  tile (`tileOff(j) = j*(Rows/Rowt)`) at 49.41 -> 9.36 tok/s and attributed it
  to thread starvation. That attribution was incomplete -- the spread also
  destroyed contiguity -- and the ADJACENT tile fixes the
  contiguity, composes with the split so the grid is not divided, and is STILL
  7% slow. So thread count was not the whole story and neither is contiguity.

  ★★★★★ **AND THE EIGHT POINTS ARE TWO TERMS, NOT ONE -- MEASURED BY
  THE GPU's OWN CLOCK, AND THE ON-DEVICE HALF IS PER LAYER RATHER THAN PER
  BYTE.** Every counter in `jit/gpu/metal` is a CPU timer: they bound
  SUBMISSION and cannot tell a device that is streaming from one idling between
  two dependent dispatches. `MTLCommandBuffer.GPUStartTime/GPUEndTime` bracket
  execution ON the device, so `token wall - GPU busy` is a measurement rather
  than the residual of a fit. Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M, Metal, 16 of 16 placed:

      token wall                       10.168 ms
      GPU executing (its own clock)     8.939 ms
      off the device                    1.229 ms  (12%)
      streaming floor at the wall       7.493 ms  (816,010,912 B / 108.9 GB/s)
      **ON the GPU and NOT streaming    1.446 ms**

  The three add to the token exactly, and against llama.cpp on the same GGUF
  (8.591 ms, floor 7.345, everything else 1.246 -- NOT split, there is no GPU
  clock on that process) jitllm's total non-streaming is 2.675 against 1.246.

  ★★★★ **AND THE "PER LAYER" HALF OF THAT WAS OVERTURNED BY A REGRESSION THE SAME
  DAY. IT IS TWO TERMS, AND THE FIXED ONE IS THE BIGGER.** The three-model table
  below divides the whole on-device excess by the layer count, which ASSUMES
  there is nothing fixed. Sweeping layers-on-card and bracketing the GPU clock
  round each arm tests that assumption instead of making it -- five points, two
  parameters, residuals under 0.08 ms:

      GPU busy = **2.554 ms + 0.400 ms x nLayers**

  The container says what to subtract (`PageSize` and `DenseBytes`, read from
  the model rather than estimated from the vocabulary): 16 blocks of 39.6 MB and
  a 182.1 MB dense read per token, which at 108.9 GB/s is 0.364 ms a block and
  1.672 ms for the dense part.

      per layer   0.400 - 0.364 = **0.037 ms**  (37 us, over 25.5 dispatches
                                                 = 1.4 us each)
      fixed       2.554 - 1.672 = **0.882 ms**  present with ONE layer placed

      16 x 37 us = 0.588 ms  +  0.882 ms fixed  =  **1.470 ms**
      directly measured on-device non-streaming: 1.446 / 1.521 ms -- IT CLOSES

  **So 6.2% of the token is per-layer and 9.3% is fixed per token.** The earlier
  "79-99 us per layer" did not hold: it was the sum of both divided by layers,
  and it made whole-layer fusion look like a 14% lever when the per-layer term
  it could attack is 6.2% and only part of that is removable.

  ★★ **AND THE FIXED TERM IS THE NEW TARGET, WHICH NOTHING HAS EVER LOOKED AT:
  0.882 ms of device time per token that does not depend on how many blocks are
  placed.** The obvious suspect was the OUTPUT HEAD -- the dense region is the
  head, 27% of a dense model's bytes, one matvec run once a token -- and it is
  REFUTED by sweeping two more models whose heads differ by 2.6x:

    | model | per-layer excess | as % of block streaming | FIXED excess | dense read |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | tinyllama q3_K_M | 0.017 ms | **6.9%** | (1.342) | 0.225 ms |
    | Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K | 0.036 ms | **9.9%** | **0.882 ms** | 1.672 ms |
    | gemma-2b Q4_0+Q8_0 | 0.049 ms | **8.6%** | **0.963 ms** | 5.120 ms |

  **The fixed term moves 1.09x while the head moves 2.6x, so it is not the
  head.** tinyllama is excluded rather than averaged in: its fit has a 0.372 ms
  worst residual and its one-layer arm is SLOWER than its zero-layer arm, which
  is the small-model regime this file already records Metal losing in.

  ★ **AND SEPARATING THE TWO TERMS CORRECTS WHAT "FLAT IN BYTES" MEANT.** The
  PER-LAYER excess is **7-10% of the block's own streaming time on all three** --
  so it is per byte after all, and the matvec simply runs at ~91% of the wall.
  What is flat in bytes is the FIXED term, which the three-model table below was
  measuring without knowing it.

  ★★★★ **AND THE FIXED TERM IS THE HEAD MATVEC AFTER ALL -- NOT ITS SIZE, ITS
  EFFICIENCY. THE HEAD RUNS AT 65% OF THE WALL WHERE THE BLOCKS RUN AT 91%.**
  The five fixed dispatches are identified in the SOURCE rather than inferred:
  `layer.go`'s `if head != nil` arm issues exactly `normPart`, `normApply`,
  `quantE` and `mvrun(bs.mvHead)` plus its reduce -- four or five, against the
  5.5 the sweep measures. So the whole fixed excess sits on that sequence, and
  the matvec is the only member big enough to hold it.

    | model | head format | MB | floor | excess | total | % of wall |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Llama-3.2-1B | **Q6_K, two-plane** | 182.1 | 1.672 | 0.882 | 2.554 | **65%** |
    | gemma-2b | **Q8_0, flat byte** | 557.6 | 5.120 | 0.963 | 6.083 | **84%** |
    | (their block matvecs) | Q4_K / Q4_0 | -- | -- | -- | -- | **91%, 92%** |

  **That resolves the "not the head" paradox above rather than contradicting
  it.** The fixed term does not track head BYTES (1.09x against 2.6x) because
  the two heads run at different EFFICIENCIES -- 65% against 84% -- and the
  bytes and the efficiency move in opposite directions. Both statements hold:
  it is the head, and it is not proportional to the head.

  ★★ **AND THE FORMAT EXPLANATION IS REFUTED BY THE SAME TWO NUMBERS, WHICH IS
  WHY THE ABSOLUTE EXCESS IS THE THING TO READ AND NOT THE PERCENTAGE.** Llama's
  head is Q6_K (4+2 two-plane) and gemma's is Q8_0 (flat byte), so a format
  penalty predicts gemma's excess to be SMALLER, and per-byte it predicts
  gemma's to be roughly 3x LARGER since its head is 3x the bytes. Measured:
  **0.882 ms and 0.963 ms -- 1.09x.** Neither prediction survives. The "65% vs
  84% of wall" is the same fixed ~0.9 ms divided by two different streaming
  times, and reading it as an efficiency difference is reading a constant as a
  rate.

  **So the head's excess is a FIXED ~0.9 ms attached to that five-dispatch
  sequence, independent of the head's size and of its format.** The equal-bytes
  sweep is also not evidence against it in either direction: `-eqbytes 384`
  already produces TALL matrices (Q4_0 at ~333k rows, Q8_0 at ~172k), so the
  aspect ratio was never the untested variable -- and it times a LOOP of one
  kernel, where the head runs ONCE, last, at the end of a 400-dispatch dependent
  chain with nothing left to overlap it. A drain at the tail of the command
  buffer is fixed-cost by nature and is what these two numbers look like.
  **Unmeasured**, and it is what the next probe should separate: the head's cost
  in situ against the same kernel run alone.

  ★★★ **AND THE UNRETAINED COMMAND BUFFER IS BUILT AND REFUTED, WHICH IS THE
  CHEAPEST OF MLX's THREE EDGES AND THE ONLY ONE TESTABLE IN A LINE.** A normal
  command buffer retains and releases every resource it references; at 413
  dispatches a token with six buffers each that is thousands of pairs, and
  `-commandBufferWithUnretainedReferences` is the same call without them.
  Paired, ABBA, one process per sample, on an idle M4, reading the GPU's own
  clock:

      per-round ratios   0.9603  0.9963  0.9978  1.0072  1.0087
      **median 1.00** -- NULL, against an effect that would have to be 10%

      retained    8.925  8.923  9.348  9.016  9.022   (spread 4.7%)
      unretained  9.003  8.987  8.977  8.996  8.989   (spread **0.3%**)

  **So the fixed ~0.9 ms is WORK, not bookkeeping** -- which in hindsight is the
  right answer for the right reason: ARC traffic is CPU-side and this term is
  bracketed by GPUStartTime/GPUEndTime. `metal.Ctx.Unretained` and
  `backend.SetMetalUnretained` stay, default OFF, as the instrument that
  produced the row; the knob trades a lifetime guarantee for work and is safe
  only while the buffers outlive the submission, which the packed arena does on
  a fully resident model and does NOT across a page-in.

  ★★★★ **AND THE RESIDENCY SET IS BUILT AND REFUTED TOO, SO ALL THREE OF MLX's
  NAMED EDGES ARE NOW ELIMINATED BY MEASUREMENT ON THIS ENGINE.**
  `metal.Ctx.Residency` creates an `MTLResidencySet`, attaches it to the
  QUEUE -- not the command buffer, because a per-buffer `useResidencySet:` pays
  the association once a token, which is the cost being hunted -- and adds every
  buffer, INCLUDING the imported ones, which is where the ~850 MB actually is.
  Paired, ABBA, one process per sample, on an idle M4:

      ratios  0.9914  0.9950  1.0003  1.0032  1.0046  1.0056
      **median 1.0018, IQR/median 0.006** -- +0.2% against an effect that would
      have to be 10%

    | MLX edge | status |
    |---|---|
    | async commit | BUILT, kept for correctness, ~6% over 600 MiB |
    | unretained references | BUILT, **REFUTED** (median 1.00) |
    | residency sets | BUILT, **REFUTED** (median 1.0018) |

  **So the fixed ~0.9 ms is not submission, not ARC traffic and not residency.
  It is work inside those five head dispatches**, and the remaining candidate is
  the TAIL DRAIN -- the head runs last, after a 400-dispatch dependent chain,
  with nothing left to overlap it.

  ★ **AND THAT NEEDS A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT, WHICH IS WHY IT IS NOT GUESSED AT
  HERE.** A per-BUFFER clock says how long the device was busy and cannot say
  WHERE in the buffer the time went; a drain at the tail and a slow kernel in
  the middle are the same number to it. `MTLComputePassDescriptor`'s sample
  buffers give per-DISPATCH timestamps and would separate them. Unbuilt.

  ★ **TWO KNOBS SURVIVE AS INSTRUMENTS, BOTH DEFAULT OFF**
  (`backend.SetMetalUnretained`, `backend.SetMetalResidency`). Each refuses
  rather than degrades: residency FAILS TO OPEN on a queue that does not answer
  `addResidencySet:`, because a set attached to nothing reads as "residency is
  not the cause" -- RULE 10's shape, and the first version of that check was an
  empty `if` that would have produced exactly that.

  ★★★★★ **AND THE FIXED TERM IS THE OUTPUT NORM AND ITS QUANTIZE, NOT THE HEAD
  MATVEC. IT TRACKS NEmbd AND IS FLAT IN VOCABULARY, ACROSS SIX MODELS.** The
  five fixed dispatches split into two families: `mvHead` (+ its reduce) scales
  with **vocab x NEmbd**, and `normPart`, `normApply`, `quantE` scale with
  **NEmbd alone**. Those axes separate across the models on this box, and the
  layer sweep gives an intercept for each:

    | NEmbd | vocab | FIXED | model |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | 288 | 32000 | **0.010** | stories15M q8_0 |
    | 576 | 49152 | **0.284** | SmolVLM-256M Q8_0 |
    | 960 | 49152 | **0.705** | SmolLM2-360M Q8_0 |
    | 2048 | 32000 | 1.218 | tinyllama q3_K_M |
    | 2048 | 128256 | 0.880 | Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K |
    | 2048 | 256000 | 0.998 | gemma-2b |

  **Monotonic in NEmbd over a 7x span, and within the NEmbd=2048 group the
  vocabulary spans 8x with no ordering at all.** So the head matvec is
  exonerated -- its bytes are already subtracted as the dense read, and what is
  left does not care how many rows it had. **The three NEmbd-shaped dispatches
  are what is left**, and 1 ms is absurd as ARITHMETIC over 2048 floats, which
  says it is their STRUCTURE: three dependent dispatches, each a full round trip,
  two of them with a grid too small to fill the device.

  ★★★★★ **AND FUSING THEM IS REFUTED BEFORE IT WAS BUILT, BY PRICING A DISPATCH
  INSTEAD OF ASSUMING ONE. A METAL DISPATCH COSTS 1.1 us, NOT 300.** `normApply`
  reads x, hNorm and part and writes h, so it is IDEMPOTENT: running it n extra
  times computes the same answer and costs exactly n extra tiny dispatches.
  `tier.Config.HeadNormRepeat` does that, and the selection check is the
  dispatch count itself -- **468 -> 669 at r=200, +201 for +200 requested**:

      r=0    468 dispatches   GPU 8.962 ms   104.60 tok/s
      r=50   487              GPU 9.095      103.06
      r=200  669              GPU 9.179      101.13
      -> **1.09 us per dispatch**

  ★ **AND IT AGREES WITH THE PER-LAYER TERM, MEASURED INDEPENDENTLY, WHICH IS
  WHAT MAKES IT A NUMBER RATHER THAN A READING.** The layer regression gives 37
  us of excess over 25.5 dispatches a layer = **1.45 us each**. Two instruments,
  two models of the cost, one answer.

    | term | dispatches | at 1.2 us | measured | verdict |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | per-layer, 6.2% | 25.5/layer | 31-37 us | **37 us** | **FULLY explained** |
    | fixed, 9.3% | 5 | 6 us | **880 us** | **not dispatch overhead** |

  **So whole-layer fusion is a CONFIRMED lever worth 6.2%** -- the per-layer
  excess is its dispatch count and nothing else -- **and the fixed 0.9 ms is
  not, by a factor of 150.**

  ★★ **AND THE SAME PROBE EXONERATES THE THREE TINY KERNELS, WHICH OVERTURNS THE
  ENTRY ABOVE.** normApply's TOTAL cost, overhead and work together, is
  1.1 us. Three such kernels cannot hold 0.9 ms between them however they are
  arranged, so "the fixed term is the output norm and its quantize" is wrong and
  the NEmbd correlation needs a different explanation.

  ★★★ **WHICH RETURNS IT TO mvHead, AND THE NEmbd SCALING NOW SAYS SOMETHING
  SHARPER THAN "IT IS THE HEAD": IT IS LATENCY-BOUND IN k.** A matvec's
  PER-THREAD work is its k-loop, and the head's k IS NEmbd. Its row count sets
  the GRID, which at 128256 rows is enormous and cannot be the constraint. So a
  cost that rises with NEmbd and ignores vocabulary is exactly a matvec whose
  threads are walking k serially -- and the head is the one matvec in the graph
  with no other work to overlap it.

  ★★★ **AND THE HEAD-ONLY k-SPLIT WAS BUILT AND REFUTES IT TOO, MONOTONICALLY.**
  `tier.Config.HeadSplit` pins the output projection's split alone and leaves
  every block matvec on the tuner, which the global knob could not do:

      tuned 8.930 ms   105.34 tok/s      16   9.113  +2.0%
      2     8.961     +0.3%              32   9.395  +5.2%
      4     8.935     +0.1%              64   9.768  +9.4%
      8     9.030     +1.1%

  **Splitting the head HARDER is monotonically WORSE.** A shorter k-loop per
  thread is exactly what the latency hypothesis asked for and it does not pay --
  the extra partials and the wider reduction cost more. So the head is not
  latency-bound in k either, and the tuner's choice is right for it after all.

  ★★★★ **AND THE HEAD MATVEC IS PRICED DIRECTLY AT 2.116 ms, WHICH IS 79% OF THE
  WALL -- THE SAME AS THE MODEL OVERALL. IT IS NOT ANOMALOUSLY SLOW, AND EVERY
  "65% of wall" READING OF IT IN THIS FILE WAS WRONG.** `mvrun` reads the
  head weights and the quantized activation and writes logits through its
  partials, so it is IDEMPOTENT and `tier.Config.HeadMatvecRepeat` prices it the
  way HeadNormRepeat priced a dispatch:

      r=0  9.014 ms    r=1  11.161    r=2  13.283    r=4  17.484
      slope **2.116 ms per head matvec**, residuals under 0.04
      streaming floor 1.672 ms -> **79% of wall, excess 0.444 ms**

  The 65% figure came from attributing the WHOLE fixed term to the head. Half of
  it is the head's, and the head is exactly as efficient as everything else.

  ★★★ **AND THAT LEAVES 0.448 ms AT nDev=1 THAT NOTHING MEASURED ACCOUNTS FOR,
  WHICH IS THE SHARPEST STATEMENT OF THE OPEN QUESTION THIS FILE CAN MAKE.**
  Every term below is measured, not modelled:

      one block (0.364 streaming + 0.036 excess)      0.400 ms
      the head matvec, priced by repetition           2.116
      normPart + normApply + quantE, at ~1.1 us each  0.003
      ------------------------------------------------------
      accounted                                       2.519
      GPU busy at nDev=1, measured                    **2.967**
      **UNACCOUNTED                                   0.448**

  ★★★ **AND THE RESIDUAL MAY BE THE PROBE, NOT THE ENGINE -- WHICH MEANS THE
  CORRECTION ABOVE IS ITSELF PROVISIONAL.** A repeat slope is a MARGINAL cost,
  and the increments say the margin is falling:

      +1 repeat  +2.147 ms      +1 more  +2.122      +2 more  +2.101 each

  Independent dispatches of the same kernel can pipeline with one another -- the
  tail of one overlapping the head of the next -- so the slope UNDERSTATES what
  the first, in-situ execution costs, by up to exactly the 0.448 residual. Two
  readings survive and a per-COMMAND-BUFFER clock cannot separate them:

      (a) the head matvec is 2.116 in situ, **79% of wall**, and 0.448 ms of
          device time belongs to no dispatch anyone has priced
      (b) the head matvec is 2.564 in situ, 65% of wall, the repeats pipeline,
          and dropping the 65% figure one entry ago was premature

  **(b) IS DEAD -- twice, by the two entries below: serial dispatch makes
  pipelining impossible, and the own-command-buffer measurement reads 2.106 ms
  cold. (a) is the answer. This pair is kept only because the way a marginal
  cost can masquerade as an in-situ one is worth recognising again.**

  ★★★★★ **AND IT IS SETTLED: THE HEAD SEQUENCE IS 2.106 ms MEASURED IN ITS OWN
  COMMAND BUFFER -- IN SITU, COLD, ONCE -- AGAINST THE REPEAT PROBE'S 2.116.
  THEY AGREE TO 0.5%, SO COLD-VERSUS-WARM IS REFUTED TOO AND READING (a)
  STANDS.** `PerLayerSubmit` already ends with `layersOnce(bs, hi, hi, ...,
  head)` -- an empty layer range carrying only the projection -- so its FINAL
  command buffer holds the head sequence and nothing else, and
  `metal.GPUBusyLast` times exactly that. The first read of 182 MB costs what an
  immediate re-read costs.

      head sequence   1.672 ms floor / **2.106 ms measured = 79% of wall**

  **The head runs at the same 79% the whole model runs at. The "65% of wall"
  figure is refuted for good, and so is every reading that made the head the
  problem.** What remains is a ~0.45 ms residual that belongs to no dispatch
  anyone has priced, at every layer count, and a per-command-buffer clock has
  now been pushed as far as it goes.

  ★★ **AND THE SAME RUN PRICES ONE-SUBMISSION-PER-BLOCK, WHICH IS A STRONG
  NEGATIVE WORTH KEEPING.** It is the arm `-ab submit` exists to compare and
  nobody had put a rate on it:

      default          **105 tok/s**   1 command buffer/token   12% off-device
      PerLayerSubmit   **70.6**        17 buffers/token         **39% off-device**

  **One command buffer per block costs a third of the rate**, and it lands
  entirely off the device -- GPU time is unchanged at 9.04 ms while the token
  goes from 10.2 ms to 14.8. The single-buffer design is not a convenience; it
  is worth 33%.

  ★★ **AND THE PIPELINING HALF IS REFUTED BY A CODE READ, NOT A MEASUREMENT.**
  `metal_darwin.go` creates its encoder with `computeCommandEncoder` and no
  `WithDispatchType:`, which is **MTLDispatchTypeSerial** -- Apple's default,
  where each dispatch completes before the next begins. Two dispatches in this
  encoder CANNOT overlap, so a repeat cannot hide behind its predecessor and the
  slope is not a pipelined margin. The 2.147 -> 2.101 drift is 2% on a harness
  whose own spread is 1-2%.

  ★ **THE COLD-VERSUS-WARM READING THAT SURVIVED THAT IS ALSO DEAD, AND THE
  ORDER OF THESE ENTRIES MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS.** Serial dispatch stops
  overlap but not cache state: a 182 MB stream touched once a token and again
  microseconds later is where TLB and prefetch differ, so the repeat slope
  could still have measured a WARMER read than the token pays. **The
  own-command-buffer measurement above settles it -- 2.106 ms cold and in situ
  against the repeat's 2.116, agreeing to 0.5%.** There is no warm-up premium.

  **Reading (a) holds without qualification: the head is ~2.11 ms in situ at 79%
  of wall, and 0.45 ms belongs to no priced dispatch.** This paragraph is kept
  BELOW the entry that settles it on purpose -- the earlier draft left the
  provisional "unless" as the last word on the page, which is exactly how this
  file's header describes a withdrawn conclusion keeping the appearance of a
  live one.

  ★★★ **AND FORCING THE IN-GROUP REDUCTION IS A SMALL REAL WIN AND AN
  UNAMBIGUOUS DETERMINISM WIN, WHICH IS THE ONE REDUCTION THIS LINE PRODUCED.**
  `GroupSplit` reduces the k-split's partials in SHARED MEMORY instead of
  launching a separate reduce kernel; the tuner picks it for 4 of 7 shapes and
  `ForceGroupSplit` applies it to all. Paired, ABBA, GPU clock, A/A FIRST:

      A/A self-control        0.9972   IQR/median 0.032   n=4
      pass 1  forcegroup/tuned  **0.9908**   IQR/median 0.0024   n=6
      pass 2  forcegroup/tuned  **0.9954**   IQR/median 0.0022   n=6

  **Call it ~0.5%, not 0.9%.** The two passes differ by half a point, the A/A
  bias is 0.3% IN THE SAME DIRECTION, and the effect is only 1.5-3x that bias --
  so the honest number is the smaller one and it sits near this harness's
  resolution.

  ★ **WHAT MAKES IT MORE THAN A READING IS THAT THE MECHANISM PREDICTED THE
  SIZE.** The dispatch price -- 1.09 us, measured independently by repeating an
  idempotent kernel 200 times -- times the 56 dispatches the in-group reduction
  removes is **0.7% of a 9.0 ms token**, against 0.5-0.9% measured. Two
  instruments built for different purposes agreeing is different evidence from
  six rounds pointing one way.

  ★★ **AND THE DETERMINISM IS NOT MARGINAL AT ALL: 405 DISPATCHES EVERY RUN
  AGAINST THE TUNER'S 445-509.** Same binary, same model -- `tuneSplit` chooses
  differently per process, and this file already prices that variance at 0.85
  points of dispersion and asks whether pinning the split is worth more than
  tuning it. Forcing the in-group reduction makes the whole submission shape
  deterministic, and the A/A control above shows what the variance costs: its
  one outlier pair (9.128 against 8.675) is the tuner, and it alone drives that
  control's 3.2% dispersion.

  **Whether it should be the DEFAULT is not settled here** -- the tuner already
  chooses it for most shapes, and 0.5% against a 0.3% harness bias is not a
  mandate. What is settled is that it never loses, it removes 56 dispatches, and
  it makes every future measurement on this box reproducible.

  ★★★★★ **THE FULL ACCOUNTING, EVERY TERM MEASURED BY A PROBE THAT VARIED ONE
  THING AND CARRIED A SELECTION CHECK. nDev=16, default submission:**

      streaming floor, 816 MB at 108.9 GB/s          7.493 ms
      dispatch overhead, 413 x 1.09 us               0.450
      head excess beyond floor + its dispatches      0.429
      ---------------------------------------------------
      subtotal                                       8.372
      GPU busy, measured                             **8.930**
      **UNATTRIBUTED                                 0.558**

  **93.7% of a Metal decode token is now attributed to a measured cause, and
  6.3% is not.** The unattributed part is smaller than the head sequence and
  spread across 413 dispatches, which is precisely what a per-COMMAND-BUFFER
  clock cannot split -- it is the resolution limit of every instrument built
  so far, not a gap in the reasoning.

  ★ **AND THE HONEST SHAPE OF THE REMAINING DEFICIT IS NOT WHAT THE GOAL
  ASSUMED.** Against llama.cpp's 8.591 ms token on the same GGUF: jitllm's
  streaming floor is 0.148 ms dearer (the Q4_K SC plane's +2.8% of bytes), its
  dispatch overhead is 0.450, its head excess 0.429, and 0.558 is unattributed.
  **No single term is more than 5% of the token**, which is why sixteen
  mechanisms could each be eliminated without the total moving: there was never
  one cause to find.

  ★★★★ **AND THE LIST OF WHAT IT IS NOT IS NOW LONG ENOUGH TO BE THE USEFUL
  PART.** Every one of these was
  measured, not argued:

    | candidate | how it died |
    |---|---|
    | submission | 3% ceiling, printed by `jitllm verify` |
    | ARC / retained references | built, paired, median **1.00** |
    | residency sets | built, paired, median **1.0018** |
    | the k-split, globally | every forced value loses to the tuner |
    | the k-split, head-only | monotonically worse, +0.3% to +9.4% |
    | dispatch COUNT | a dispatch is **1.09 us**; five of them is 6 us, not 880 |
    | the three tiny norm kernels | normApply's whole cost is **1.1 us** |
    | the head's SIZE or FORMAT | flat across an 8x vocabulary span |
    | a chain-length drain | fully present at nDev=1, 31 dispatches |
    | a floor in the clock | stories15M's whole GPU token is 0.540 ms |

  What survives is an empirical fact with no mechanism: **the fixed cost rises
  with NEmbd** -- 0.010 ms at 288, 0.284 at 576, 0.705 at 960, 0.88-1.22 at 2048
  -- **and the 38% spread inside the NEmbd=2048 group says NEmbd is not the whole
  story either.** The instrument that has not been built is per-DISPATCH
  timestamps (`MTLComputePassDescriptor` sample buffers); every probe above is
  per-COMMAND-BUFFER and cannot say which of the five dispatches holds it.

  ★★ **THE OTHER HALF IS NOT OPEN, BUT ITS LEVER IS ONE QUARTER THE SIZE OF THE
  TERM AND SAYING OTHERWISE WAS AN OVERCLAIM.** The per-layer 6.2% IS its
  dispatch count -- two independent measurements agree at ~1.2 us -- and it does
  NOT follow that fusion recovers 6.2%. **A transformer block cannot be one
  dispatch**: Metal has no device-wide barrier inside a kernel, and every row's
  q must be finished before any row's scores can start. Only ADJACENT
  ELEMENTWISE runs merge, and counting them in one layer:

      normPart + normApply + quantE -> 1, twice a layer    4 dispatches
      rope q + rope k -> 1                                 1
      the activation folded into the up matvec's epilogue  1
      ----------------------------------------------------------
      6 of 25.5 = 24% of the per-layer term = **1.4% of the token**

  **6.2% is what dispatch overhead COSTS. 1.4% is what fusion can RECOVER.**
  Those are different numbers and the shelved-levers list's "whole-layer fusion"
  entry, which records 14.18%/14.81% on MoE, is measuring a MIXTURE layer --
  which has far more dispatches per layer than a dense one and where the same
  reasoning gives a much larger answer. It does not transfer to a dense model.

  ★ **AND THIS REVERSES "THE FIXED TERM IS THE HEAD MATVEC" FROM TWO ENTRIES
  AGO.** That rested on Llama and gemma alone -- two points, both at NEmbd 2048,
  which cannot separate the two families. Adding four models with NEmbd from 288
  to 960 separates them, and the answer changes. Two points agreeing is not a
  correlation; it is a coincidence with a standard error of zero.

  ★★ **AND THE FOUR NEW ROWS WERE WRONG ON FIRST COMPUTATION, WHICH IS WHY THE
  PROBE NOW PRINTS THE DENSE *READ*.** A container's dense REGION is not its
  dense READ: an untied model's region holds `token_embd` AND `output.weight`,
  and a token reads all of the head and exactly ONE ROW of the embedding.
  Subtracting the region over-subtracts by the whole table and gave two models a
  **NEGATIVE** fixed term -- a cost below its own floor, impossible, and the only
  reason the error was visible. stories15M is the clean case: 19.6 MB of region,
  **9.8 MB read**, exactly half.

  ★★ **AND THE k-SPLIT IS EXONERATED TOO, WHICH WAS THE CHEAPEST REMAINING
  SUSPECT AND NEEDED NO NEW CODE.** `tuneSplit` picks ONE policy at load; every
  block matvec is 2048-8192 rows and the head is 128256, so a split right for
  the blocks could be badly wrong for a matrix 16-60x taller -- and that would
  land exactly where the time is. Forced against the tuner, reading the layer
  sweep (n=1 is ~85% head, since one block is 0.364 ms of a 3.051 ms arm):

      split    n=1 GPU   n=16 GPU    vs tuned
      tuned      3.051      8.814     --
      4          3.061      9.113     +0.3% / +3.4%
      8          3.077      9.096     +0.9% / +3.2%
      16         3.193      9.343     +4.7% / +6.0%
      32         3.414      9.758    +11.9% / +10.7%

  **The tuner wins at every point and the head does not want a different split.**

  ★★ **AND TWO MORE EXPLANATIONS DIE ON DATA ALREADY TAKEN, WHICH IS WORTH
  SAYING BEFORE ANYONE BUILDS A PROBE FOR THEM.**
  - *"A drain after a long dependent chain."* The fixed term is FULLY PRESENT at
    nDev=1, where the chain is 31 dispatches, and is the same at nDev=16 where
    it is 413 -- that is what a constant intercept under an excellent linear fit
    means. A cost that needs 400 preceding dispatches cannot be whole at 31.
  - *"The metric has a floor -- GPUStartTime/GPUEndTime brackets a fixed
    scheduling window."* stories15M-q8_0 measures **0.540 ms/token of GPU time
    in total**, which is less than the 0.88 ms floor that explanation requires.
    The instrument does not have one.

  **So the fixed term is not submission, not ARC traffic, not residency, not the
  k-split, not a chain-length drain, and not an artefact of the clock. It is
  ~0.9 ms inside five dispatches on the two large models and under 0.54 ms on a
  small one, and its mechanism is UNRESOLVED.** The instrument that has not been
  built is per-DISPATCH timestamps (`MTLComputePassDescriptor` sample buffers);
  a per-buffer clock cannot say which of the five it is.

  ★ **THE OTHER CANDIDATE, KEPT BECAUSE IT PREDICTS THE SAME SIGN AND IS NOT A
  KERNEL.** The MLX comparison lists what
  jitllm does not have: *"residency: MTL::ResidencySet, standing
  requestResidency(), size-capped | none"*, beside
  `commandBufferWithUnretainedReferences`. A command buffer with no residency
  set makes its resources resident per submission, and this engine hands it
  ~850 MB of buffers once a token. That predicts a cost roughly independent of
  WHICH model, which is what the two gating rows show. **Unmeasured**, and it is
  the next thing to price rather than the next thing to build.

  ★ **AND THE DISPATCH COUNT THAT ARGUED AGAINST FUSION WAS WRONG BY TENFOLD, IN
  THE FLATTERING DIRECTION.** `TestDeviceDecodeRate` printed "45 dispatches" by
  dividing CUMULATIVE launches by CUMULATIVE commits -- averaging the device arm
  over the whole process, warm-ups and the HOST arm included, and the host arm
  commits nothing and launches nothing. Bracketed round the timed arm it is
  **413 per token**, and the sweep gives its shape: 31 / 57 / 107 / 209 / 413 at
  1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 layers, i.e. **25.5 per layer plus a fixed 5.5**. At 45 a
  token there would have been nothing for fusion to remove; at 25.5 a layer
  there is, and it is worth 1.4 us each.

  ★★★ **AND THE ON-DEVICE TERM IS FLAT IN BYTES, WHICH ELIMINATES THE UNPACK BY
  MEASUREMENT.** Three models, three format families:

    | model | bytes MB | floor | GPU | on-GPU not streaming | per layer |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M | 816 | 7.493 | 8.939 | **1.446** | 90.4 us |
    | tinyllama q3_K_M | 618 | 5.673 | 7.416 | **1.743** | 79.2 us |
    | gemma-2b Q4_0+Q8_0 | 1672 | 15.357 | 17.138 | **1.781** | 98.9 us |

  **Bytes span 2.7x and the term spans 1.02x.** gemma-2b has the CHEAPEST unpack
  in the tree (a nibble and one scale, no minimum array and no secondary plane)
  and the LARGEST term, so this is not the k-quant arithmetic that the CPU-tier
  entries above correctly convict on their own tier, and it is not per-byte
  under any amount of noise. **The "79-99 us per layer" column that stood here
  is overturned by the regression above** -- these three cannot separate a
  per-layer term from a fixed one, because dividing by the layer count assumes
  the answer.

  ★ **SO THERE ARE TWO LEVERS AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT SIZES.** Whole-layer fusion
  attacks the per-layer 6.2% (25.5 dispatches a layer at 1.4 us of stall each);
  the shelved-levers list records it at "14.18%/14.81% on MoE", and a MoE layer has far
  more dispatches than a dense one, so those numbers are consistent with this one
  rather than equal to it. The FIXED 9.3% is bigger and has no entry on that list
  at all.

  ★ **WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED.** Three models,
  one sample each -- NOT RULE 2 rows. What survives that is the SHAPE, not the
  digits: a quantity that moves 1.02x while its supposed driver moves 2.7x is
  not per-byte under any amount of noise. Per-LAYER and per-DISPATCH cannot be
  separated by these three, because dispatches per layer is roughly constant
  across dense models. And llama.cpp's 1.246 ms is NOT split by a GPU clock, so
  which half of jitllm's excess it avoids is still unknown -- Metal System Trace
  on both engines is the instrument, and it has still not been taken.

  ★ **AND EVERY TUNABLE IS ALREADY AT ITS OPTIMUM, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS A
  KERNEL REWRITE RATHER THAN A SETTING.** Swept on the M4, Llama-3.2-1B, -n 64:

      SPLIT   0(fitted) 99.15 | 1 91.88 | 2 97.08 | 4 98.64 | 8 99.64 | 16 96.27
      ROWT    1 98.88 | 2 98.69 | 4 99.88 | 8 98.85
      TOK     1 99.11 | 2 99.03 | 4 98.76
      LANES   16 99.08 | 32 98.75
      MVACC   1 99.42 | 2 100.05 | 4 99.79 | 8 98.67
      QTILE   64 98.59 | 128 99.59 | 256 99.39

  Every knob lands between 98.6 and 100.1 -- one band, no outlier. The kernel is
  saturated at its current design point and the remaining nine points need a
  different one. **MLX's `qmv_fast` is the shape to read**
  (`mlx/backend/metal/kernels/quantized.h`): `num_simdgroups = 2`,
  `results_per_simdgroup = 4` -- eight output rows per threadgroup, one row per
  simdgroup reduced through the free shuffle, and NO k-split or partial-sum
  reduction at all. jitllm k-splits and reduces partials; that is the structural
  difference to price.

  ★★★ **AND THE BYTES LEVER DOES NOT PAY ON tinyllama, MEASURED ON
  BOTH M4 TIERS. THE ENTRY BELOW NAMES IT AS THE METAL LEVER AND THAT IS NOW
  CONTRADICTED.** Q5_K went native (container v15, -12.65% of tinyllama's bytes,
  the same GGUF converted by the commit either side). Same-pass ABBA on a quiet
  M4, A/A self-control FIRST:

    | tier | A/A control | v15/v14 | IQR/med | bytes/token | GB/s | % of the 105.7 wall |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Metal | -- | **1.0096** | 0.004 | 786.7M -> 687.3M | 93.9 -> 82.8 | 89% -> 78% |
    | CPU | 0.9970 (IQR 0.005) | **1.0058** | 0.002 | same | 43.6 -> 38.4 | 41% -> 36% |

  **12.65% fewer bytes bought 0.96% and 0.58% of tokens.** Both rows gate tightly
  -- the CPU A/A dispersion is 0.5% -- so this is not noise swallowing an effect.

  ★ **THE TWO QUANTITIES NOT AGREEING IS THE FINDING.** The v14 gemma-2b row is
  the counter-case and it is quoted above: -8.55% of bytes gave +8.2% of rate,
  "the two quantities agreeing -- measured separately, one from a file size and
  one from a stopwatch -- is what makes this more than a timing result". Here
  they disagree by a factor of thirteen, so tinyllama decode is NOT
  bandwidth-bound on either M4 tier, and the CPU number says it is not close: 41%
  of the wall, against the 59.7 GB/s this same box reaches on gemma-2b.

  ★★★ **AND THE PER-FORMAT COST IS NOW MEASURED AT EQUAL BYTES, WHICH CONVICTS
  THE TWO-PLANE UNPACK AND INDICTS THE Q5_K CHANGE ITSELF.**
  `nn.TestPerByteCost` (JITLLM_PERBYTE=1) prices every packed format on the host
  kernels at ~96 MiB EACH, so only the format varies. M4, v15:

    | format | shape | GB/s | % of fastest |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Q8_0 | flat byte | **71.8** | 100% |
    | Q4_0 | nibble | 64.0 | 89% |
    | Q3_K | nibble + high mask | 51.4 | 72% |
    | Q4_K | nibble + min array | 46.5 | 65% |
    | Q5_K | **4+1 two-plane** | **30.0** | **42%** |
    | Q6_K | **4+2 two-plane** | **27.1** | **38%** |

  **★ THE TWO BOTTOM ROWS ARE SUPERSEDED: Q5_K IS 44.31 AND Q6_K 35.09 SINCE
  `ee73352` MERGED THE PLANES BEFORE THE DOT.** They are kept as the BEFORE arm
  of that measurement -- see the plane-combine entry below, which is what they
  motivated and what refutes them as a standing.

  **The two TWO-PLANE formats are the slowest by a factor of 2.4-2.6**, and the
  ordering follows the unpack's arithmetic exactly: a flat byte, then a nibble,
  then a nibble plus one more term, then a nibble plus a second PLANE.

  ★★ **AND Q5_K WAS ONLY TWO-PLANE BECAUSE THIS FILE MADE IT ONE, AN HOUR
  EARLIER. THE SAME BENCH ON THE COMMIT BEFORE:**

    | Q5_K | v14, 8-bit single plane | **44.7 GB/s** (62%) | 2209 B/row | 20.2M rows/s |
    | Q5_K | v15, 4+1 two-plane      | **30.0 GB/s** (42%) | 1440 B/row | 20.9M rows/s |

  Native packing bought 37.5% fewer payload bytes and cost **33% of the per-byte
  throughput**. They very nearly cancel: 3.4% in rows per second, which IS the
  0.58% measured end to end. The change stays -- it is a small throughput win and
  a real 12.65% container reduction, which matters for residency and upload --
  but **the bytes did not buy the rate, and framing it as a bandwidth win was
  wrong.**

  ★★ **AND THE MECHANISM IS COUNTABLE FROM THE EMITTER, NOT ONLY OBSERVABLE IN
  THE TIMING: A SECOND PLANE MEANS A SECOND DOT.** `EmitA64PackedMatVec` issues
  the primary plane's SDOTelem in its nibble loop and the secondary plane's in a
  SEPARATE pass, into the same accumulator -- `a.SDOTelem(VReg(g), t0, ...)`
  appears in both. Counting issues per element from the loop bounds:

    | format | sub | pw | hw | primary | secondary | SDOT per element |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Q4_K | 32 | 4 | 0 | 2*4 = 8 | 0 | **0.25** |
    | Q6_K | 16 | 2 | 1 | 2*2 = 4 | 4 | **0.50** |

  **Q6_K issues TWICE the dot instructions per element**, which is the measured
  2.4x. The host splits a weight into two dot products because a dot is linear;
  the DEVICE does the opposite and this file already says so -- "both device
  kernels XOR the planes into the full weight first and center once". On amd64
  the split is deliberate and free (VPDPBUSD takes unsigned bytes and the hi mask
  is pre-shifted to 0x30, so both products land in one accumulator). On arm64
  SDOT is signed-by-signed and a combined weight is 0..63, which fits int8 --
  **so the planes could be ORed before the dot and one SDOT would serve both.**

  ★★★ **AND IT WAS BUILT (`ee73352`), AND IT IS THE LARGEST arm64
  KERNEL WIN SINCE THE PACKED MATVEC ITSELF.** One SDOT on the combined byte in
  place of two, plus `BIT16b` -- Bitwise Insert if True -- folding the merge's
  AND and ORR into one vector instruction. `nn.TestPerByteCost` on the M4 at
  ~96 MiB per format, alternated A/B/A/B in one session, 16 paired rounds over
  two passes:

    | format | was | now | ratio | % of the fastest format |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | **Q5_K** | 30.30 | **44.31** | **1.377** | 42% -> **62%** |
    | **Q6_K** | 27.06 | **35.09** | **1.271** | 38% -> **49%** |
    | Q8_0, Q4_0, Q3_K, Q4_K | -- | unchanged | 1.000-1.013 | A/A controls |

  The worst control moves 1.3% against effects of 27% and 38%, and the two hi
  formats go from 0.50 SDOT per element to Q4_K's 0.25. **It is arm64-only by
  construction**: amd64's split is already free, because VPDPBUSD takes unsigned
  bytes and both products land in one accumulator, so that path must not change.

  ★ **AND IT IS GATED ON `hw == 1` RATHER THAN ASSUMED.** One secondary word per
  (sub-block, row group) is addressable from a single cursor; both formats that
  have a secondary plane now are hw == 1 by arithmetic. A future hi format
  with hw > 1 keeps the two-pass path, which stays rather than being generalised
  speculatively.

  ★★ **SO THE CASE AGAINST NATIVE Q3_K IS WEAKER BUT NOT GONE, AND ITS
  ARITHMETIC HAS TO BE REDONE BEFORE ANYONE QUOTES IT.** The case read: Q3_K
  is a 4-bit single plane at 51.4 GB/s, native means the two-plane shape, "whose
  two members sit at 27-30 GB/s" -- so trading ~40% of the per-byte rate for 25%
  of the bytes loses. **Those members now sit at 35-44**, so the trade is ~25%
  of the rate for 25% of the bytes and the sign is no longer obvious. It is NOT
  thereby a win: a native Q3_K needs a 2-BIT primary plane, a third emitter
  shape nothing here has measured, and its per-byte cost is unknown rather than
  interpolatable from the 4-bit formats. **The bytes argument alone does not
  settle it, and the 2-bit primary's cost has never been measured** -- the number
  that would settle it is one `TestPerByteCost` row that does not exist yet.

  ★★ **THE ORIGINAL SUSPICION, KEPT BECAUSE THE MEASUREMENT ABOVE IS WHAT
  SETTLED IT.** tinyllama is q3_K_M, and Q3_K is
  the most arithmetic-heavy format to unpack -- a 4-bit primary plane plus a
  high-mask reconstruction per weight. If the binding constraint is that
  unpacking rather than the bus, then making Q3_K NATIVE (a 2-bit primary plane,
  "a third emitter shape") REMOVES BYTES THAT ARE NOT COSTING ANYTHING AND ADDS
  UNPACKING WORK TO THE THING THAT IS. It could be a net LOSS. That is a
  hypothesis, not a measurement -- but the measurement that would settle it is
  cheap (price the unpack against the load at a fixed byte count) and it should
  be taken BEFORE the emitter is written, not after.

  ★★★ **AND THE CONSTRAINT IS THE k-QUANT UNPACK, MEASURED DIRECTLY: THE SAME
  M4 MOVES 60 GB/s ON CHEAP-UNPACK FORMATS AND 38.5 ON k-QUANTS.** One binary,
  one pass, interleaved, CPU tier:

    | model | formats | tok/s | bytes/token | GB/s | % of 105.7 wall |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | gemma-2b | Q4_0 + Q8_0 | 35.89 | 1,676,656,640 | **60.2** | 57% |
    | tinyllama | Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K | 55.95 | 687,255,552 | **38.5** | 36% |

  **The bus does 60 GB/s on this box when the format is cheap to unpack.** So
  tinyllama at 38.5 is not traffic-limited, and the 1.56x between the two rows is
  the per-byte ARITHMETIC of the k-quant unpack -- a sub-block scale, a minimum
  array and a secondary plane per weight, against Q4_0's nibble and one scale.
  gemma's 35.89 tok/s also reproduces the container M4 board row (jitllm 35.6),
  so the harness agrees with the recorded standing.

  ★ **THIS IS WHY THE BYTES LEVER PAID 0.6%, AND IT REDIRECTS THE MAC WORK.**
  The remaining M4 deficit on a k-quant model is the UNPACK, not the traffic --
  and this file already names the unbuilt piece of exactly that: "Q4_K and Q5_K
  still cannot use the arm64 INTEGER fold (36.9% of a tinyllama prefill's MACs)
  ... Worth the remaining 5 -> 3 instructions per (sub-block, row, vector)."
  That is the lever with a measurement behind it. Native Q3_K packing is the one
  WITHOUT: it removes bytes that are not costing anything and adds work to the
  thing that is.

  What remains unexplained: the ~120 tok/s ceiling Metal holds on tinyllama
  regardless of traffic. The CPU tier's 36% is now accounted for; the Metal
  tier's is not, and the two may not have the same cause.

  ★★ **THE OLDER CLAIM, KEPT BECAUSE IT IS WHAT THE FILE SAID AND IT IS WHAT THE
  MEASUREMENT ABOVE CONTRADICTS.**
  tinyllama q3_K_M: llama.cpp's GGUF is **523.67 MiB** and the same model's
  container is **750.3 MiB** -- **+43%** -- because Q3_K packs to a 4-bit plane
  (the packed-payload table above: "Q3_K | 4 bits | +34.5% | 3 bits needs a
  2-bit PRIMARY plane, a third emitter shape"). Decode is bandwidth-bound, so
  that is a direct tax on every token, and jitllm reaches PARITY on this model
  only by running ~26% more bandwidth than llama.cpp does. **Native Q3_K packing
  is the Metal lever, not the command buffer.**

  The async commit stays: it is correct (tower NMSE unchanged at 2.802e-07),
  worth ~6% on the models over 600 MiB, and neutral on the small ones. It is
  kept for being right rather than for a number.

  1. **THE BLOCKING WAIT, WHICH IS NOW DONE AND WAS THE SMALLER HALF.** `metal_darwin.go`'s `Batch.Commit`
     is `commit` followed immediately by `waitUntilCompleted`, and `mtlSession.
     finish` calls it -- so EVERY session is a full GPU round trip with the CPU
     idle. MLX's `CommandEncoder::commit()` commits and immediately takes the
     next buffer; `waitUntilCompleted` lives only in `synchronize()`, called
     when the host actually needs a value. A decode token opens several sessions
     (`tier/layer.go` x3, `tier/tier.go`), so jitllm pays that latency several
     times a token.
  2. **RETAINED REFERENCES COST PER ENCODE.** A normal command buffer retains
     and releases every resource it references; at ~254 launches a token that is
     a lot of ARC traffic for nothing, since the arena outlives the buffer
     anyway. `commandBufferWithUnretainedReferences` is the same call without it
     -- and it is only SAFE because something else guarantees lifetime, which is
     what the residency sets are for.
  3. **RESIDENCY SETS BOUND THE RE-RESIDENCY COST.** macOS decides residency per
     SET, so MLX spreads allocations over several size-capped sets rather than
     one: when a set loses residency under pressure only that set is made
     resident again. llama.cpp announces the same thing (`use residency sets =
     true`).

  **What jitllm already has and must NOT be confused for mmap:**
  `newBufferWithBytesNoCopy` wraps host memory the engine ALREADY OWNS (the
  packed arena) so the GPU addresses the same physical pages -- Apple Silicon
  has one pool. It maps no file; `jlm` still reads with ReadAt/O_DIRECT into its
  own buffers, and `Ctx.Import` asserts the no-copy claim by checking
  `contents == p`. **The NO-mmap rule is intact and this is not a breach of it.**

## A device buffer that is never freed is invisible to every paging gate

- **★ A DEVICE BUFFER THAT IS NEVER FREED IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY PAGING GATE, AND
  WAS FOR THE LIFE OF THE TIER.** `func (b *fakeBuf) Free() {}` -- every fake
  buffer in `jit/gpu/tier`'s tests discarded it, so the gates asserted a block
  was PAGED OUT and never that its memory came BACK. Once fixed, it
  found four leaks immediately (Close never freeing g.layers, blockScratch
  having no free path at all, PrepLayer overwriting a resident block without
  freeing it, and a second Close hanging forever on a nil channel). On CUDA
  `cuCtxDestroy` reclaims the context, so none was a driver-level leak -- which
  is exactly why they survived, and stops being true on a unified-memory device.
  **The lesson generalises past this package: a counter that counts the
  ACQUISITION certifies nothing about the RELEASE.**

  ★ **AND A LEDGER ONLY COVERS THE PATH IT RUNS.** The text ledger was green
  while every VISION block leaked its two MLP biases: the upload walks six
  biases (Bq, Bk, Bv, Bo, BUp, BDown) and BOTH free walks covered four, so a
  text block -- which has no BUp or BDown -- could never see it. Found by
  `TestVisionTowerReturnsEveryDeviceBuffer` on its first run, 8 buffers over 4
  blocks, at the site `ReleaseLayers`' own comment warns about: *"two copies of
  the walk is how one of them acquires an eighth tensor and the other does
  not"*. The upload grew a vision case and neither free list did.

## A submission longer than the driver's fence timeout reads back half a tower

On the Iris Xe (vulkan:1) MiniCPM-V's tower, every block placed, read back a
residual with NMSE 0.99-1.43 against the host on the 45x23 overview, and
Phi-4-reasoning-vision's 56x28 photo 0.97; the 24x24 picture of the same gate
passed, and so did every other backend. Placing a prefix of the tower bisected
it to a count: 20 blocks at 5.1e-3, then 0.17, 0.36, 0.54, 0.73 and 1.03 for
21 through 25, a block's worth of residual missing per block past the 20th.

The tower went as one submission (`Stats.Submits` 1) and took 18.7 s, 0.93 s a
SigLIP block over 1035 patches. The kernel log named it, once per encode:

    Fence expiration time out i915-0000:00:02.0:model.test[3011359]:5e6!

`CONFIG_DRM_I915_FENCE_TIMEOUT` is 10000 ms on this kernel: a fence still
pending after it is signalled anyway, `vkQueueWaitIdle` returns success and the
read-back is whatever the blocks before the cut wrote. No error reaches the
engine, so nothing short of a comparison against the host can see it.

`devTier.submit` now cuts a range by run time as well as residency
(`tier/subbudget.go`): each submission takes as many blocks as
`Config.SubmitBudget` (1 s by default, half Windows' TDR and a tenth of i915's
fence timeout) holds at the per-block cost measured for that row count, rounded
to a power of two. A row count not yet measured, from 64 rows up, is probed with
one block; a decode token never is, so a model that fits still decodes a token
as one submission (`TestAModelThatFitsNeverPages`). An estimate rises at once
and falls by halves, so one fast submission cannot license a range a slow one
showed would overrun. On the RTX a tower block over the same picture is
milliseconds and the range stays whole after the probe.

The gates: `tier.TestASubmissionIsCutAtItsRunTimeBudget` (the cut, its count
and the residual against the uncut range, on the fake device; against a submit
that ignores the budget it reads one submission) and, on the hardware,
`model.TestMiniCPMVOnDeviceMatchesHost/vulkan:1` (5.1e-3 against 1.4) and
`TestPhi4RealMatchesTransformers/photo896x448/vulkan:1` (1.7e-4 against 0.97),
with `JITLLM_STEP_DEVICES` naming vulkan:1.

## A tower's device set was built for its largest grid, not the picture

HunyuanOCR's tower takes grids up to 65536 patches (`TowerConfig.MaxSeq`),
and the device built its non-causal set -- the scratch, the score rows, the
shared k/v pair, the batched twins -- for that many rows at placement
(`batchWidthFor` returned `MaxSeq`; `capped` left a vision plan uncapped, its
comment calling the patch count "fixed and known up front", which a
dynamic-resolution tower makes false). After the tower's first block:
`ScratchBytes` 5,669,846,908 against a 2.3 GB budget on the Iris Xe, where the
device's memory is host RAM ("7150082744 of 2309747506 used (pool host
RAM)"). It was allocated before the budget was asked: under an 8 GB cap the
process was OOM-killed; at 24 GB no tower block placed, every text block
relocated home past the overcharge, and the 5.5 GB stayed. On the 4 GB RTX the
allocation itself failed (`vkAllocateMemory`, `cuMemAlloc`), so no real
Qwen-family tower ran a block on any device here. Had it placed, every call
would have run all 65536 rows for a picture of 1024: kernels bake their row
count.

`jit/gpu/tier/visrows.go`: the set is built for `visCap` rows, which `capped`
hands every tower plan as its MaxSeq. Placement starts at `visStart` (1024)
or the tower's MaxSeq when smaller (a fixed-grid tower's picture).
`ReserveRows` (`nn.RowsReserver`), called by `State.encodeBlocks` before a
picture's blocks run and outside any submission, moves it to the picture's
rows rounded up to an eighth of their power of two (at most a quarter more
rows than the picture): up when the picture is larger, after asking the budget
for the build's bytes -- extrapolated from what the set it replaces measured
(`blockScratch.bytes`), its score planes priced exactly since they are capped
(`visionChunk`), the k/v pairs at the new rows -- and down when the picture
needs half the set or less. A picture the budget cannot hold is refused with
nothing allocated, and the State takes tower blocks home, highest first, until
it fits (`State.reserveTowerRows` over `relocateUntil`): it encodes on the
host, never out of memory. A first tower block the budget refuses after its
set was built takes the set with it, and so does the last tower block out
(`dropIdleTower`). The host's per-picture buffers (the patch gather, the
position rows, the resampled table's taps and rows) are sized by the picture
too.

Gates. `tier.TestATowerIsBuiltForItsPicture` (the fake device, a 65536-row
grid on a 256 MB card): placed at 1024 rows for 55,492,616 bytes, 164,315,156
at 3072 for a 3000-row picture, the 65536-row grid refused with no buffer
allocated, 19,374,088 at 512 for a 500-row picture, nothing live after the
release, and a block refused for its weights leaves nothing of its set.
Against the violations: the set built for the grid declines the first block
("out of memory ... 268435456 of 268435456 live"); no fit check before the
build allocates 32 buffers for the refused picture; no release on a refused
block leaves 55,492,616 bytes live. And `model.TestQwenVLRealMatchesTransformers`
now demands, per device asked for, that tower blocks are placed and every
placed one ran there (`State.vis.devBlocks`) with the set built for the
picture (`Stats.TowerRows`); where the text model, placed first as the CLI
places it, leaves no room on a 4 GB card, the tower is held to a card of its
own. On the laptop (text then tower; "alone" is the tower on a fresh card):

## The sm_80+ prompt: what the 0.07-0.33 rows were, and the staged GEMMs

A board taken with `scripts/vs-llamacpp.sh` on A10G, L4, L40S and A100
cards read jitllm's prefill at 0.07-0.33 of llama.cpp's (Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M
3994 against 17413 tok/s on the A10G), while the V100 board, taken with
`jitllm speed`, read 1.04-1.38. Two causes, counted on the RTX 3050 Ti
(sm_86), the one Ampere card at hand:

- **The harness timed a cold engine against a warm one.** Prefill mode ran
  `jitllm run -n 1` and took its "prompt" figure: the first prompt of a fresh
  process. `speed.go` already said that figure is not a prefill rate. A CPU
  profile of the first 512-row prompt in a process: 30 ms of ~200 growing the
  KV pool (`allocPages` -> `growKVLayer`), 43 ms outside the kernels in all,
  against 155-165 ms warm. llama-bench runs a warm-up and never times
  context creation. That fixed cost is a larger share the faster the card,
  so it compressed the big-card rows most. The jitllm arm is now
  `jitllm speed -p N -n 0 -r 1` (JITLLM_PP_COLD=1 keeps the old one). On the
  laptop, both arms warm against the old cold arm, same pass:

      Llama-3.2-1B Q4_K_M   cold 0.44 (REJECTED, IQR 0.114)   warm 0.59
      Qwen3-0.6B Q8_0       cold 0.38                         warm 0.75
      Qwen3.5-0.8B Q4_K_M   cold 0.77 (REJECTED, IQR 0.124)   warm 0.91 (REJECTED, IQR 0.163)

- **Every prompt matvec on sm_80/86/89 was MatVecMMA**, the unstaged int8
  kernel: each warp reads its weights and its activations from global memory
  inside the MMA loop and decodes every weight once per 32 tokens. sm_70 had
  GemmVolta (shared-memory staged, binary16) and the newer cards never
  reached it, since voltaMV runs only where the integer instruction is
  missing (rows.go `voltaMV`'s `!(g.mmaOff || g.NoMMA)`). Per-launch device
  time of a warm 512-row Llama-3.2-1B prompt (nsys sees no kernels through
  goffi and ncu needs counters this box withholds, so
  `backend.SetCUDAKernelTiming` now times launches outside a capture): 105 of
  165 ms in the FFN's three projections, 26 in the attention (FMA
  accumulate 15, m16n8k16 scores 5.6, softmax 5.7), 12 in the activation
  conversions and SiLU.

What was built, every kernel generated:

- **GemmVolta on m16n8** (`VoltaTile.F16K`: 16 from sm_80, 8 on sm_75): the
  same staging, lane (g, q) reading chunk q of rows g and g+8 and token g as
  one 16-byte load each. The k order inside a chunk needs no permutation:
  word 4q+2s+h of A meets the same word of B.
- **GemmInt8**: MatVecMMA's arithmetic staged as llama.cpp's MMQ stages it:
  a trip of 32 elements decoded once a workgroup to signed bytes with
  float32 scales and minimums per sub-block, the int8 activations with their
  scales and sums beside them, a lane's two words one 8-byte load. Bit for
  bit the dp4a matvec unsplit. The default on sm_80 and later.
- **PagedAttnAccMMA**: the weighted sum of V on m16n8k8 behind the m16n8k16
  scores: 6.5 ms where the FMA tiles read 15.
- **The tile and split by the card** (`fillTile`, `fillSplit`): about one
  workgroup an SM, sm_70's measured bar, so a 1024-row projection does not
  leave a 142-SM card with one workgroup on every second SM.

What the laptop could and could not show. On the RTX 3050 Ti the three GEMMs
read 8-15 TFLOPS in isolation (`TestGemmF16Speed`, 512 rows), interleaved and
noisy: the binary16 GEMM sits at GA107's float32-accumulate ceiling (~15
TFLOPS at 1.5 GHz, half the binary16-accumulate rate on a GeForce part), and
the int8 GEMM and MatVecMMA land in the same band, so on this card the
change of kernel is inside the noise of the warm board (Llama-3.2-1B 0.59
before, 0.63 after with the binary16 GEMM). Its ceilings are not the
A100's (binary16 with float32 sums at the full rate, int8 at twice it) or
an Ada card's (int8 at four times the float32-accumulate rate), and the rows
that matter have to be taken there.

## Measurements once cited in jit/gpu/tier's comments

The tier's comments state the engineering reason and the class of card; the
measurements they used to carry, with the machine that produced them, are
here verbatim.

- `groupTokMax` (`jit/gpu/tier/rows.go`): "Llama-3.1-8B Q4_K_M on a V100,
  tok/s together, groupMV against the tiled twin: 2 sessions 203 / 146, 4
  307 / 270, 8 363 / 488."
- `dropSession` (`jit/gpu/tier/layer.go`), on why the scratch's bound is not
  reset: "(measured: pp512 on a V100 17.4k tok/s on the first prompt of a
  process and 13.7-14.0k on every one after)". The bisection is "The prompt
  lost 22% on the V100, and none of it was a kernel" above.
- `promptBuf` (`engine/model/prefill.go`): "A request is a fresh State, and
  allocating these per request cost a V100 prompt of 512 rows 6.6 ms of its
  33.9 (a fresh 4 MiB heap span faults in page by page): the device ran at
  19.5k tok/s and the prompt measured 15.1k."
- The comments that now name a class of card were measured on these: the
  Volta-class figures (Llama-3.2-1B's 12 MB of batched-twin scratch in
  `prepLayer`, the 0.9 ms `prepBatch` walk, the `ragMV` Tok/Rowt sweep,
  `voltaMV`'s ~2.3x over the dp4a twin and its ~1280-warp split, the
  `voltaTiles` 2x2 grid, `kb0Split`'s 80 SMs, `volta70AccMT`'s halved
  accumulate, `PagedPrefill70`'s selection check, `keepsSlot`'s
  `TestPrefillStreamsHostBlocks` case) on a V100; the integrated-GPU figures
  (`restride`'s 65535-group dispatch limit, `visrows.go`'s 2.3 GB budget,
  `subbudget.go`'s 0.93 s SigLIP block under i915) on an Iris Xe; the Apple
  Silicon figures (`flashTileAttn`'s 32-row blocking, `tileGemms`' 64x64 lead)
  on an M4; and the k-split's 30720 resident slots (`tier.go`, 20 SMs x 1536)
  are an RTX 3050 Ti's.

## Design notes moved out of source comments

Each entry below is a comment that stood in the named source file,
verbatim. The source keeps the contract, the layout and the invariants
and points here for the derivation, the transcript and the reasons.

### jit/gpu/kernels/ropetab_const.go

The rotary table's constant block and its layout: the {cos, sin} pair per
rotary pair, formed by a kernel rather than math.Cos/math.Sin in Go.

One copy of the layout for four tiers (AVX2, SSE, NEON and the device): the
layout is the ABI between the emitters and nn. It lives here rather than in
jit/cpu because jit/cpu already imports this package, so a device kernel
importing jit/cpu would close a cycle; jit/cpu/ropetab_const.go re-exports
every name.

The precision lives in the constants. The angle is pos*g radians with pos up
to 131072 -- thousands of radians, where an f32 ulp is 5e-4. So the position
is decomposed into four 7-bit digits and each digit's contribution is folded
mod 4 quarter-turns at setup, in float64:

	pos = d0 + 128*d1 + 128^2*d2 + 128^3*d3          (d_i in [0,128))
	v   = pos*g*2/pi = sum_i d_i * U_i   (mod 4),  U_i = fmod(g*128^i*2/pi, 4)

and the kernel needs only frac(v) and floor(v) mod 4, which survive because
the reduction mod 4 distributes over the sum.

Each U_i is split so its digit product is exact. H_i is U_i rounded to a
multiple of 2^-12, so it needs at most 15 significant bits; a digit needs 7;
7+15 = 22 < 24, so d_i*H_i is exact in float32. The four products sum to at
most 2032 (8323072 units of 2^-12, under 2^24), so the sum and its mod-4
fold are exact too. The only rounded quantity is the residual plane
L_i = U_i - H_i, whose digit product is under 0.0156, giving ~1e-9
quarter-turns of error (~1e-7 radians at every position; see
engine/nn/ropetable.go).

The per-model block is PLANE-MAJOR -- all of H0, then all of H1, ... -- so a
kernel reads each plane as one contiguous vector and the four digit
broadcasts stay in registers for the whole table:

	word 0*S .. 1*S-1   H0      the 2^-12 head of U_0
	word 1*S .. 2*S-1   H1
	word 2*S .. 3*S-1   H2
	word 3*S .. 4*S-1   H3
	word 4*S .. 5*S-1   L0      U_0 - H_0, the residual
	word 5*S .. 6*S-1   L1
	word 6*S .. 7*S-1   L2
	word 7*S .. 8*S-1   L3
	word 8*S            mscale  (rope.scaling.attn_factor, or 1)

where S = RopeTabStride(npairs).

## RULE 11e's cases

Four limits that read as hardware and were choices, found while making
sessions run at once on one device:

- **A lock per request.** The server held a device for a whole generate
  because the tier "serialises sessions on a device". The tier took its
  scratch per step; the server had copied that limit up to the whole
  request, so a long API answer blocked a chat until it finished.
- **The device-wide current session.** `devTier.cur` and `switchTo` made the
  session an implicit argument read in about sixty places, which forced one
  session per device at a time. Passed as an argument, it went.
- **"CUDA runs one stream in order."** One stream does; the backend had put
  every session on the legacy stream. Two sessions on non-blocking streams
  ran their kernels at once only after the next case was found.
- **Pageable copies.** With a stream per session the two still took 1.92x
  of one alone: a copy from pageable memory is staged by the driver
  synchronously and held the other stream's kernels back. Through a pinned
  arena per queue, 0.95x.

And one that was real: NVIDIA's laptop Vulkan driver runs dispatches from
two submissions one after another, on two queues or one (2.00x both ways),
while its datacenter driver on the V100 overlaps them (1.00x). The way past
it on that driver is to record the sessions' work into one submission,
which is the step loop's batching.
