// Package amdgpu lowers jit/gpu/ir kernels to LLVM IR text for AMD GPUs.

// comgr (jit/gpu/hip.Comgr.Compile), whose AMDGPU code generator owns
// instruction selection, register allocation and scheduling, as ptxas does for
// PTX. See docs/design/amd-hip.md for why the target is LLVM IR and not GCN
