// still exist on the host and a repack plus DMA if they do not. The arena keeps
// the pack. Where the device can unpack a format itself from the raw bytes
// (kernels.Unpack), tier's resident() asks that first; the arena serves the
// formats it cannot, and a hit uploads packed bytes with no kernel at all.
//
// On a unified device the pack is the device buffer (importPacked wraps its
// pointer), so resident() asks importing() before either.
//
// It is a second copy of a block's bytes, and the device layout is wider than
// the file's for some formats, so retention is budgeted and defaults to zero;
// see NewArena. The bytes are meaningless to jit/cpu (transposed and
// normalised to value = scale*q - bias).

// bytes it was packed from, and `block` is an opaque tag the caller uses to
// release entries together.
