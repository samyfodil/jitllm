// split into a head H_i on a 2^-12 grid, whose digit products and their sum
// are exact in float32, and the residual L_i = U_i - H_i. The per-model block
// is PLANE-MAJOR, S = RopeTabStride(npairs) words a plane:

// RopeTabConsts is the shared constant block every rotary-table kernel reads --

// The magic is a rounding, not a mask: x - ((x+M)-M) with M = 2^25 is x minus
// the nearest multiple of four, because at 2^25 an f32 ulp is exactly 4. The
// remainder is in [-2,2], congruent to x mod 4, and exact for every x the
// digit products can produce (at most 2032).
//
// pi/2 is split in two so one rounded f32 pi/2 does not put a 5e-8 relative
// error on every angle (the same remedy exp.go uses for ln2).
//
// The polynomials are degree 7 in sin and 8 in cos: on |r| <= pi/4 these
// minimax fits are accurate to about 1e-8, an order under the reduction's
// ~1e-7. One degree less would make sin's truncation (4.5e-7) the largest
// error term.
//
// The last two words are the device's alone. A SPIR-V driver (NVIDIA's
// Vulkan path) reassociates (a+b)-b to a, so the magic returns zero; the
// device therefore folds mod four in integers: s is a sum of exact multiples
// of 2^-12, so s*2^12 is an exact integer under 2^24, masking it with
// 4*2^12-1 is the remainder, and scaling back is exact. RopeTabMod4MaskWord is
// that mask (and the device's violation surface for the fold).
//
// The half: the IR's only float-to-integer op, ir.OpCvtI32, truncates, where
// the host rounds to nearest. The integer fold leaves the remainder in [0,4),
// so s+c is never below -1/16 and truncating s+c+0.5 is the floor. The two
// roundings differ only at an exact tie, where the quadrant swap and sign flip
// give bit-identical results because the sine fit is odd and the cosine even.
// A remainder differing from the host's by a multiple of four changes n by the
// same multiple, leaving f = rem-n and bits 0 and 1 of n unchanged.
