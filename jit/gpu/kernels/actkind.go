// activation code 2 is. It is an enum rather than a bool because there are
// more than two ungated activations (CLIP's tower is quick-GELU).

	// ActQuickGELU is x*sigma(1.702x), the activation OpenAI's CLIP trains
	// with and the one llama.cpp selects when an mmproj sets neither
	// clip.use_gelu nor clip.use_silu.
	//
	// It is neither GELU nor SiLU and either substitution is silent: GELU-tanh
	// parts from it by about 0.02 around |x| = 2, and SiLU is it with 1.702
	// set to 1.
	ActQuickGELU
	// ActSigmoid is the activation alone: sigma(x), not x*sigma(x). A gated
	// attention output is out*sigma(g) with out and g different vectors, so
	// a SiLU kernel would compute g*sigma(g)*out, wrong by a factor of g.
	ActSigmoid
	// ActSwiGLUOAI is gpt-oss's gated activation, and it exists only gated:
	//
	//	x = min(gate, 7)   y = clamp(up, -7, 7)   out = x*sigma(1.702x) * (y+1)
	//
	// Three differences from SwiGLU, each silent alone: the gate is clamped
	// from above only, the up projection from both sides, and (y+1)
	// multiplies rather than y. The constants are the architecture's
	// (llama.cpp hardcodes alpha 1.702 and limit 7; the GGUF carries neither).
	ActSwiGLUOAI
	// ActReLU2 is max(x, 0)^2, the squared ReLU Nemotron's ungated FFN runs
	// (llama.cpp's LLM_FFN_RELU_SQR). It is the one activation here with no
	// exp, and like the others it is baked rather than branched.
	ActReLU2
	// ActReLU is max(x, 0): DeepSeek V3.2's lightning indexer applies it to
	// each head's score before the heads' weighted sum.
	ActReLU
	// ActIdentity is no activation: gated, dst = dst * up, an elementwise
	// product. Gemma 3n scales the active AltUp stream by a learned vector
	// before its per-layer input gate.
	ActIdentity
	// ActXIELU is Apertus's xIELU, ungated, with four numbers per block
	// (alpha_p, alpha_n, beta, eps). It is in neither set below: the numbers
	// are a buffer, so its kernels are XIELU here and cpu's EmitXIELU rather
	// than Act's baked forms.
	ActXIELU
	// ActSwiGLUClamp is DeepSeek V4's gated activation, SwiGLU with both
	// operands clamped and nothing else changed:
	//
	//	x = min(gate, 10)   y = clamp(up, -10, 10)   out = x*sigma(x) * y
	//
	// It is swiglu-oai's clamp without that kind's alpha (1.702) and offset
	// (y+1), at another limit; substituting either kind is silent. The limit
	// is the architecture's (jlm.Flag2SwiGLUClamp).
	ActSwiGLUClamp
	// ActSqrtSoftplus is sqrt(softplus(x)), DeepSeek V4's router gate over
	// each expert's logit. Ungated. softplus is the |x| form,
	// max(x,0) + log(1 + exp(-|x|)), so nothing overflows and no branch is
	// needed (the delta rule's gate builds it the same way).
	ActSqrtSoftplus
	// ActSitu is Kimi-K3's gated activation (Moonshot's SituAndMul), which
	// bounds both operands with a scaled tanh and gates the first by its
	// sigmoid:
	//
	//	out = 4*tanh(gate/4)*sigma(gate) * 25*tanh(up/25)
	//
	// The bounds are the architecture's (activation_situ_beta and
	// activation_situ_linear_beta, 4 and 25 in the published config); the
	// converter refuses another pair. Substituting SwiGLU is silent below the
	// bounds and wrong past them.

// ActSitu's tanh is a rational in x, x*P(x^2)/Q(x^2) on x clamped to
// +-TanhClamp (Eigen's generic_fast_tanh_float), on every tier. The exp form
// GELU and the softcap use, 1 - 2/(exp(2x)+1), loses its relative precision
// as x goes to zero, and situ multiplies the result back up by its bound (25
// on up), which takes that loss past the 1e-5 every elementwise kernel here
// holds; the rational keeps ~3e-7 relative everywhere. TanhP is the
// numerator's odd coefficients from x^13 down to x, TanhQ the denominator's
// even ones from x^6 down to 1.
