// A device serves several sessions at once. What it holds for all of them --
// the blocks, the kernels, the paged history, the recurrent pools, the budget
// -- is its devShared. What a session's calls write is the session's own: the
// per-call fields below (devSess), and the scratch a call runs in (a lane). A
// devTier is one session's view of one device: the three together, and the
// counters its writes go to.
//
// The scratch is the expensive part, so a lane is held for a call, not for a
// session's life. lane0 is the scratch placement builds; a call takes it when
// it is free, and otherwise the lane its session ran in last, any other free
// lane, or a new clone of lane0 (takeLane) -- built from lane0's plans and
// charged to the budget as scratch. Sessions that step one after another run
// in one lane, as they did when the scratch was the device's; each session
// stepping at the same time as another costs one more.
//
// lane0 is what placement, PrepHead, a capacity growth and every other change
// of shape act on, through the device's own view (devShared.dv). A clone is
// not kept in step with it: laneGen moves when lane0 changes shape, and a
// clone built at an older generation is dropped rather than run.
//
// A vision tower's set is not cloned: it is one per device (visrows.go), as
// the tower's k/v pair is (transientkv.go), and a call whose lane is a clone
// runs a tower's range in lane0 (lane0View).
