// KVRoom is how many more positions of attention history the devices can take
// without sending a page home: in every layer a device's pool holds, the pages
// it has free and the pages the budget lets it grow by, priced at one page of
// every layer at once, and the fewest of any device, since a sequence grows in
// every layer together. page is the pool's positions a page (0 with no pool);
// a sequence takes whole pages, so a caller adding up sequences rounds each up
// to it. A device with no attention layer does not bound it.
//
// It is what a scheduler admits by: rows whose histories fit it all stay on
// the card and step together, where rows past it send their oldest pages home
// and stream them back every token (kvevict.go) -- correct, and slower by the
// whole history crossing the bus once a step.
