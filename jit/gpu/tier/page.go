// Block paging: a device holds N block slots and swaps, instead of declining a
// block and losing it for the rest of the run, so a card smaller than the model
// still runs every block. See docs/design/block-paging.md.
//
// A block's weights have a backing store (the packed arena, or the container),
// so they can leave the card and come back byte-identical. Its KV cache is this
// session's own history and nothing else holds a copy; norms, biases and the
// router are kilobytes. So:
//
//	pageable    the quantised matrices
//	permanent   the KV cache, the norms, the biases, the router
//
// The permanent part bounds how many blocks a device can own; the pageable part
// is what the slots hold. Both come out of the same budget, so admitting a
// block shrinks the slot count (see slots). A device that cannot page (fewer
// than minSlots) declines per block exactly as before.
//
// The structure is always built and the budget is the control: every block
// gets a page record whether or not the model fits, so SetBudget can demote a
// model that currently fits (make room for another, hand the card back). On a
// model that fits eviction never fires: pageIn is a lookup, submit coalesces
// the whole range into one submission, and PageOuts stays at zero.

// minSlots is the fewest block slots a device can page with. One, because a
// swap needs one slot (evict, read in, run): a one-slot pager cannot overlap
// upload and compute, but refusing it sends the block to the host instead,
// and a card can be one page short of two slots.
