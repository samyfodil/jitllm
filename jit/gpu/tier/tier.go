// Package tier is jitllm's GPU decode tier: an nn.Device backed by the generated device kernels (jit/gpu).
//
// tier.GPU is a router over one devTier per card, each with its own residency
// map, budget, kernels, staging buffers and lock. It places a model's blocks
// across them fastest device first, in contiguous runs, falling back to the
// host. tier.Open is the one-device path; OpenWith and New are the
// several-device ones. See multi.go for which device, and the type comments in
// this file for which state is per device and which is shared.
//
// nn declares the device interface and this package implements it, so the
// dependency runs from here to nn and never the other way.
