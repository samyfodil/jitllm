// Submissions in flight.
//
// A session's submission runs outside g.mu (layersOnce), so another session's
// bookkeeping goes on beside it. Most of that bookkeeping touches only what
// its own session reads -- its pages, its table run, its lane -- and needs
// nothing more. What changes something every submission may read -- a buffer
// a recording names, a block's weights, a page another sequence's descriptor
// points at, a recurrent pool's slots -- waits for every submission in flight
// to complete first (quiesce), and holds g.mu while it changes it, so none
// starts until it is done. A submission whose range writes what is the
// device's rather than the session's (a vision tower's set and k/v pair, a
// streamed block's expert cache, a recurrent pool, the rows of several
// sessions) runs alone: it quiesces and keeps g.mu across its Session, which
// is the whole device as it was before sessions ran at once
// (exclusiveRange).
//
// A KV page released while submissions are in flight is fenced with the
// ticket the next submission will take (subClock.seq), and is reused only
// once every submission holding a ticket up to it has completed -- or at once
// when none is in flight -- so a page a running submission might still read
// is never handed to another sequence under it (kvLayerPool.fence).

// subClock is the device's submission tickets: seq is the next one to be
// taken, live how many are in flight and oldest the smallest of them (seq
// when none is).
