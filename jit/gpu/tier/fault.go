// Fault injection, compiled in only under the `jitllmfault` build tag.

// It makes a device fail on demand, which is the only way to exercise the
// recovery path that brings the KV cache home and finishes on the host. It is
// a tag rather than a runtime flag so that no release binary can be told to
// pretend its GPU broke; the untagged build compiles to `return false`.
//
// It takes a list of call ordinals because the interesting state needs two
// failures: a batched prefill chunk fails, is retried per token, and a later
// retry fails after some rows already went through the device (calls 1 and 3).

//
//	"window"  a windowed layer reads the full descriptors: no window at all
//	"alias"   every row of a batch reads the first row's pages
//	"softwidth" the staged prefill's softmax launched 64 wide whatever its
//	          lanes: two subgroups on one item, where Metal runs the width
//	          it is given
//	"session" every row of a step across sessions reads and writes the
//	          current session's pages, not its own session's
//	"passclip" a prefill pass reads every key, not its own: each key counts
//	          once per pass
//	"winrelease" a windowed layer releases the page its window starts in,
//	          with no slack: the window reads the dummy page
//	"stale"   a page-in uploads the bytes the block's host slices held at
//	          admission, without asking the host for them again: whatever
//	          block the host pager has since put in that frame

//	"slot"    every row of a step across sessions reads and writes the first
//	          row's seat: sessions sharing one summary
//	"parity"  a session the step brings to the other half of a pool is not
//	          copied there: it reads a half its last step did not write
//	"resize"  a pool rebuilt at another size, or a seat that grows, carries
//	          no session's state
//	"chain"   every row of a ragged step is its own run: a prompt chunk's
//	          rows each read their sequence's state from before the step

//
//	"headone"  the one-row head launches decode's own kernel, which reads the
//	           wanted row's sums where the second row's scales are
//	"nocap"    the per-row head skips the final softcap: every row's argmax
//	           and logits are the uncapped projection's
//	"swatab"   a step's local layers are handed the global rotary table
//	           (csSWA is cs), the shape of the table a rows step once
//	           never passed; it reaches the logits only where the device
//	           uploads the host's tables (Config.RopeTableHost)
//	"noswa"    a step hands the device no local rotary table at all
//	"nope"     a ragged step rotates the layers Llama 4 leaves unrotated
//	"notemp"   a ragged step skips Llama 4's attention temperature
//	"nowin"    a ragged step's windowed or chunked layers attend every key

//	"floatsrc"  a float bank's down reads the gate's output where the
//	            activated product belongs: same shape, finite, wrong
//	"downsrc"   the same for a quantized bank's down, on the dp4a and the
//	            tensor-core forms alike: its activation is converted from the
//	            gate's output
//	"wout"      a grouped mixture that weights the expert's input (Llama 4)
//	            weights its output instead
