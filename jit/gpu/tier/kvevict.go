// Eviction: a pool that cannot grow sends pages home rather than refusing
// (docs/design/device-kv-paging.md, "Errors and eviction").
//
// A sequence's pages leave oldest first, the same page in every layer that
// holds the sequence, so its evicted prefix is one count (kvPool.evicted) and
// one set of descriptors still serves every layer. An evicted page's id in the
// sequence's run is 0 -- the dummy -- and its bytes are the layer's home copy.
// Attention over a history with an evicted prefix streams (pagedstream.go):
// a pass uploads as many evicted pages as the layer has free ids into them,
// runs over them, and the passes' partials fold into one. A pass costs a Sync,
// so its width is every page nobody holds at that moment -- memory that would
// otherwise sit idle -- rather than a fixed count, and Config.KVStreamPages
// forces it (SetKVStreamPages at run time). Eviction keeps one id free beyond
// the call's own growth: the fewest a pass can make progress with. Only a pool
// too small for that -- the dummy and the page being written -- refuses, and
// relocation answers the refusal as it answers any.
//
// Residency is planned by the host, which evicted the pages and knows which
// they are, rather than faulted from inside a kernel: every attention layer
// reads its whole history, so there is no sparse read for a fault to save. The
// in-kernel fault the design describes is what a windowed or sparse read wants,
// and is not built.
