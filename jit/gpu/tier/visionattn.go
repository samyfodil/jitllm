// A vision block's attention in query chunks.
//
// A vision block is one submission over the whole image (visrows.go), and
// its score and probability planes are rows x NHead x stride floats each. For
// Gemma 3's SigLIP that is 4096 x 16 x 4100 x 4 bytes, 1.07 GB a plane, which
// no 4 GB card holds beside anything else. The keys are the whole image either
// way, so the queries are what can be cut: each chunk's rows are gathered into
// a chunk-sized q, run through the same score, softmax and accumulate kernels
// built for the chunk's row count, and their output scattered back -- the same
// arithmetic per row, only fewer rows at a time. Nothing else in the block
// changes, and a tower whose planes fit runs exactly as before.

// visionPlaneBudget is the most the two score planes of one vision block may
// take before its attention goes in chunks.

// visionChunk is how a vision block's attention takes its query rows: all of
// them when the two score planes fit budget, else passes of arows -- a
// multiple of 16 and of both kernels' tiles -- over a scratch of capRows rows.
// arows is the largest such chunk that fits; a divisor of rows is preferred
// when one is at least half that, and otherwise the scratch's rows are rounded
// up to whole chunks. The rows past the run are capacity: a pass writes their
// output and nothing reads it, and the key counts and windows cover them
// (keyruns.go). Over budget the attention always goes in chunks, whatever rows
// factors into -- a capacity of four times a prime had no halving that divides
// it, and its planes were allocated whole.
