// A page-in that uploads the GGUF bytes raw and unpacks them on the device.
//
// When a model is paged through a card too small for it, the host repack was
// most of the token, and the arena cannot help because the packed model does
// not fit host RAM either. So the raw bytes are uploaded as they lie and the
// card does the bit extraction (kernels.Unpack carries the per-tensor A/B). No
// host allocation happens on this path: Buf.Write takes the weight slice
// straight to the driver. The arena still wins on a device whose heap is host
// memory, and is the only answer for formats whose GGUF block is not a
// multiple of 4 bytes (see arena.go).
//
// The kernel reads pSrc and writes pQS/pD/pSC, four distinct buffers, so the
// IR's clamped surplus threads only recompute and re-store the same words
// (ir.Validate enforces it). The destinations are not poisoned: the thread
// mapping writes every word of all three arrays exactly once, which
// TestUnpackMatchesHostPacker checks with poisoned buffers.

// unpackWidth is the workgroup width the unpack launches at. It matches the
// [128,1,1] the kernel was built with; the two are one number in two places and
// UnpackThreads is what stops the launch re-deriving the mapping.
