//     output -- and the question it was answering goes with it, since nothing
//     answered it. Kept, it would put two user messages in a row, which a
//     template like Mistral's refuses to render at all ("Conversation roles
//     must alternate"), so one failed reply would break every turn after it.
//   - a system turn in the transcript is display; the system prompt is its
//     own field, and emitting both would send it twice.

// system is emitted first when non-empty, and prompt last as the user's turn,
// carrying images.
