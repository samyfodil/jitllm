// Fairness is the step loop's policy between throughput and the spread of
// the requests' waits, one level from 0 to 100 (Config.Fairness).
//
// At 0 the loop is first come first served: a request waits for a free row
// and the card's room for its history (kvRoom), a row runs until its
// generation ends, and the admitted prompts are fed oldest first. That is the
// most tokens a second, and under load the worst wait: a request behind a full
// card gets nothing until whole generations ahead of it finish (on a V100 at
// 64 concurrent, a first token minutes out while the rows ahead decoded at
// 12-16 ms a token).
//
// Above 0 three mechanisms engage, each monotonic in the level:
//
//   - Time slices. A decoding row that has generated its quantum of tokens
//     since it was admitted or resumed is parked when a request is waiting
//     for its row or its room (model.State.Park: its blocks' KV and recurrent
//     state home from the card, its sealed pages into a store), and the
//     waiting request is admitted in its place. The parked row waits in the
//     same queue and resumes byte for byte (State.Resume) when its turn comes;
//     its next token is sampled from the logits it held, so its answer is the
//     one it would have given unparked. The quantum shrinks with the level,
//     from fairQuantumMax tokens at 1 to fairQuantumMin at 100.
//   - Fair prompt feeding. The level's share of a step's prompt budget is
//     split evenly across the prompts admitted after the oldest, a window of
//     one to three (fairWindow), the rest fed oldest first as at 0, so the
//     oldest prompt does not hold the next ones at zero while it runs.
//   - Ordering. The queue -- new requests and parked rows alike -- is served
//     by the time each began waiting (a parked row's is when it was parked),
//     a high-priority request (jitllm_priority) counted as having waited
//     fairBoost longer. Age dominates past that head start, so nothing
//     starves, and the head start shrinks as the level rises.
//
// A parked row's history is on the host while it waits, so a swap costs the
// bus its history twice; that is the throughput the level spends.
