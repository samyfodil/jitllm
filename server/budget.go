// Something here has to divide it because nothing in the engine does:
// sched.MemBudget() is stateless and model.Open, tier.OpenWith and NewState
// each read it independently, so two models would each believe they hold the
// machine. The cgroup then throttles into reclaim, and neither pager can see
// the other model. (The vision tower avoided this by sharing one container
// and one budget; two models are two files and cannot.)
// pins are per-model caps the user set. They are honoured exactly and come off
// the top; the rest divide what is left.
//
// total is the budget, read once by the caller: sched.MemBudget follows the
// machine's free memory, so two reads of it are two different numbers, and a
// division checked against another moment's budget can exceed it.
