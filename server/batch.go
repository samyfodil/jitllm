// stepLoop is continuous batching for one loaded model, on its devices or on
// the host.
//
// A generate on a session whose every block and head are on one device, or
// whose every block and head are on the host, does not take the gates for
// itself. It becomes a ROW of the model's step loop: one goroutine that owns
// every live row's model.State, and each step gathers each row's next token
// and runs them through model.StepRuns -- one device step for all of them
// (nn.SessionStepper), or one host pass over the weights (State.HostSteppable),
// every block's weights read once, each row's history its own session's. Each
// row then
// samples its own logits with its own sampler, exactly as the one-at-a-time
// path does, and its events go to an outbox its request goroutine drains, so a
// slow client never holds up a step.
//
// The loop is recorded on the model's gates while it has rows. Nothing queues
// on a gate (gate.go), so the loop admits a waiting request as a row whenever
// it has room (Config.MaxBatchRows), and a session on the one-at-a-time path runs
// beside it, the two interleaving a step at a time rather than one waiting for
// the other to finish.
//
// A joint step is not always the faster: for each row count the loop times it
// against running the rows one session after another, in situ, and runs the
// faster (batchchoose.go; Config.JointSteps forces either).
//
// A new row's prompt is fed a chunk at a time inside the same steps
// (promptUnits): its chunk rides beside the decoding rows' tokens, so
// admission never stalls them by more than the rows it adds to a step. A
// prompt whose State pipelines its prefill across several cards takes that
// path instead, a pipelined chunk at a time, beside the joint step.
//
// The Go work of a step that does not feed it -- each sampled token's text,
// its stop-string check where the row has none, its event -- runs on a helper
// goroutine while the step runs (stepPost), so it leaves the critical path.
